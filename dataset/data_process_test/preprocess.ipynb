Another approach physically limits what onlookers can see. As mentioned, this can be done by strategically locating displays in the environment to restrict how passers-by can view the display and its content or using special display techniques [11] . More generally, commercially-available privacy filters -screens attached atop of displays -cause the display to appear increasingly dark as the onlooker's viewing angle increases. Thus people looking at the screen from the side will not see anything. Because privacy filters do not stop a shoulder-surfer from seeing the screen from a straighton position, strategic positioning of the display and body shielding must still be done. To our knowledge, privacy filters are usually restricted to relatively small displays (e.g., tablet to desktop displays), likely because it would compromise how a person could look around a very large screen.\", 'cite_spans': [{'start': 222, 'end': 226, 'text': '[12]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF11'}, {'start': 521, 'end': 525, 'text': '[11]', 'ref_id': 'BIBREF10'}], 'ref_spans': []}\n",

Edward Hall's proxemics theory describes how one's social distance is correlated to one's physical distance from another person [10] . Hall defined four proxemic zones surrounding a person, beginning with the intimate zone at the center, and moving through the personal, social, and finally the public zone at the perimeter. As the names imply, social engagement is expected to increase as one approaches the other. This theory was exploited by Vogel et al. [22] to define four proxemic zones for large display interaction. His system was an event calendar that shows both public and personal information. From afar, the display presents ambient, undetailed public information. As one moves closer, the information presented and interaction allowed become increasingly detailed and personal. If a second person enters the area, the display is split to provide each with an area to view their own personal information. To safeguard privacy, a person can perform certain gestures, or simply step back away from the display to hide or mute personal information. Building on this work, Ballendat et al. [3] describe the Proxemic Media Player, which incorporates people's position, orientation, movement and identity in order to control a media player.

They classified identified research publications based on highlevel keywords (e.g. 'Green IT', 'Green IS', 'Sustainable', 'Business Process' etc). While the study provides a high level of classification, it does not explore in depth the BPM concepts typically seen in ES research, nor the contribution of BPM to various EPIs. Opitz et al.

Their study identified 127 papers of which 11 were relevant to BPM. The relevant papers were classified based on 'attitude', 'strategy', 'governance', 'modelling', 'optimizing', 'monitoring' factors and further proposed a conceptual Green BPM readiness model motivated by the Green ICT Readiness Model (Wabwoba et al. 2013 ). Nevertheless, the study did not explore EPIs to which contributions were made and had a more narrow focus. Opitz et al. (2014a) then extended the review with a study of 56 articles searching for definitions and concepts related to Green BPM. This follow-up study classified literature based on categories of 'Green IT/IS', 'BPM', 'Green BPM' and classified the papers based on their contribution to subcategories of 'Reduce Environmental Impact', 'Monitoring', 'Economical', 'Cultural Change' and 'Definition'.

      "{'section': 'Related Work', 'text': \"The first step of our research was the analysis of the context in which we wanted to design the innovative services. Studying the permanent literature we tried to identify the services which have been offered until now, by the airports. The basic characteristic of this context is the limited time that a passenger/visitor consumes while (s)he visits an airport. Normally, either heavy passengers (people who travel once every three months of more often) or light passengers consume one and half hours in the airport, before they travel; on the other hand airport offers sixty (60) minutes of free Internet in order to fulfil his/her needs. Bruseberg (2001) confirms that the most useful way to understand peoples' needs is focus groups. Having studied the existed services, the next steps are on the one hand the investigation of the needs that our target group wants to fulfil the most; and on the other hand the investigation of services that could be considered as innovative. For this reason we conducted five focus groups: two of them consist of managers and employees of the firms and the other three of consumers. Every focus group was consisted of 6 people. In order to choose the members of the groups we used Matthing's questionnaire (2006) (Appendix). Matthing proved that being based on how innovative a person can be considered, we may recognise five types of people (starting from the most innovative to the less one): leaders/ explorers, pioneers, sceptics, paranoids and laggards. The questionnaire was distributed in 59 people of the airport community. We chose 30 people and in every group there was at least one leader/ explorer and no paranoids and laggards.\", 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': []}\n"
