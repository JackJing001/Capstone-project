They classified identified research publications based on highlevel keywords (e.g. 'Green IT', 'Green IS', 'Sustainable', 'Business Process' etc). While the study provides a high level of classification, it does not explore in depth the BPM concepts typically seen in ES research, nor the contribution of BPM to various EPIs. Opitz et al. (2014b) explored the acceptance of ES in BPM literature and studied the potential of developing models and methods to measure an organization's ability to implement Green BPM. Their study identified 127 papers of which 11 were relevant to BPM. The relevant papers were classified based on 'attitude', 'strategy', 'governance', 'modelling', 'optimizing', 'monitoring' factors and further proposed a conceptual Green BPM readiness model motivated by the Green ICT Readiness Model (Wabwoba et al. 2013 ). Nevertheless, the study did not explore EPIs to which contributions were made and had a more narrow focus. Opitz et al. (2014a) then extended the review with a study of 56 articles searching for definitions and concepts related to Green BPM. This follow-up study classified literature based on categories of 'Green IT/IS', 'BPM', 'Green BPM' and classified the papers based on their contribution to subcategories of 'Reduce Environmental Impact', 'Monitoring', 'Economical', 'Cultural Change' and 'Definition'. However, the extent of theoretical contributions, detail of BPM and ES concepts covered in the study remains unspecified, and a focus on EPIs is lacking.\", 'cite_spans': [{'start': 97, 'end': 117, 'text': 'Stolze et al.

The authors focused on articles from prominent IS and BPM journals and highly ranked IS and BPM conferences, with one study seeking further sources in non-English international conferences and journals.

Our study extends these efforts to provide deeper and more specific insights into the In an effort to identify as many relevant articles as possible, we relied on Google Scholar rather than purely IS or BPM academic publication outlets, although we used such a data set initially to identify relevant keywords.

      "{'section': 'Related Work', 'text': \"The first step of our research was the analysis of the context in which we wanted to design the innovative services. Studying the permanent literature we tried to identify the services which have been offered until now, by the airports. The basic characteristic of this context is the limited time that a passenger/visitor consumes while (s)he visits an airport. Normally, either heavy passengers (people who travel once every three months of more often) or light passengers consume one and half hours in the airport, before they travel; on the other hand airport offers sixty (60) minutes of free Internet in order to fulfil his/her needs. Bruseberg (2001) confirms that the most useful way to understand peoples' needs is focus groups. Having studied the existed services, the next steps are on the one hand the investigation of the needs that our target group wants to fulfil the most; and on the other hand the investigation of services that could be considered as innovative. For this reason we conducted five focus groups: two of them consist of managers and employees of the firms and the other three of consumers. Every focus group was consisted of 6 people. In order to choose the members of the groups we used Matthing's questionnaire (2006) (Appendix). Matthing proved that being based on how innovative a person can be considered, we may recognise five types of people (starting from the most innovative to the less one): leaders/ explorers, pioneers, sceptics, paranoids and laggards. The questionnaire was distributed in 59 people of the airport community. We chose 30 people and in every group there was at least one leader/ explorer and no paranoids and laggards.\", 'cite_spans': [], 'ref_spans': []}\n"
