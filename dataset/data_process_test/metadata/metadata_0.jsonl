In this context, two major trade and investment agreements that could lead to profound influence on low-carbon energy systems development around the Asia-Pacific region are the Regional comprehensive economic partnership (RCEP) consisted of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, and Republic of Korea and the Belt and road initiative (BRI) initiated by China. In order to have a smooth transition to low-carbon energy systems in Asia, besides RCEP and BRI it is imperative to boost private sector investment. Success of encouraging private sector investment depends on appropriate government policies towards promoting innovations and reducing financial risks to private investors. The research questions that are examined in this study are: What type of policy measures affects trade in low-carbon transition, particularly renewable energy (RE) transition? How can investment signals and incentives be reframed to scale up private finance in RE? The objective is to investigate and to provide several feasible trade policy and investment policy tools for both national and regional markets that governments could adopt to accelerate the speed of private financing of the low-carbon energy industry, particularly the RE industry.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.25082/ree.2019.02.005", "venue": "Resources and Environmental Economics", "journal": "Resources and Environmental Economics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2947409793", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["157891746", "169641559", "155016766"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:191680764"}

They also examine the implications of current policy and the possibility for rationalizing competing government priorities. Because governments face budget constraints and cannot fully subsidize all programs and activities, the authors argue the following: a) Public spending on health can (1) improve health outcomes, (2) promote nonhealth aspects of well-being (for example, reducing individuals'risk of economic losses from random health crises), and (3) finance redistribution to the poor. Optimal subsidy and fee policy will depend on how much relative weight government places on those competing objectives. Subsidies need to be reallocated toward the poor and toward public health sector can financed by increasing public subsidies. b) Prices for curative services (user fee) have two distinct roles. They can raise revenue, freeing public resources to be reallocated to public health activities and for limited cofinancing to improve the quality of curative care. More important, they can improve efficiency in the use of public facilities and the health care system as a whole. But those gains must be weighed against evidence that increased fees can compromise public health's three main goals. The literature has focused largely on how raising revenue affects the poor, but the more important effect is likely to be the guidance of resources. User fees are important in cofinancing health care but shouldn't be the primary means of finance. c) Revenue generated from user fees is sometimes used to improve the quality of, and access to, curative medical care. There is some evidence that people are willing to pay some of the cost of improving health care (especially for drugs), but the wealthy are willing to pay a lot more than the poor. If governments charge the average\"willingness to pay,\"the wealthy will use the services more, the poor, less. d) Prepayment social insurance plans hold promise, but there is evidence that they may introduce inefficient inflation of medical care costs that lower- and middle- income countries cannot afford.", "year": 1997, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1596/1813-9450-1762", "venue": "Innovations in Health Care Financing: Proceedings of a World Bank Conference", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2158561407", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["73089482", "154556217", "166824880", "41600220", "79293975", "1205507", "166726975", "78123528", "9712113", "168869981", "153471076", "152416628", "168664852", "12354158", "6424376", "68701502", "153880316", "23751451", "25057280", "20483988", "166394063", "157855305", "30310802", "4164674", "23120311", "72451048", "152802035", "151018925", "57692016", "22798616", "45090453", "153337378", "7442081", "154337263", "19704248", "40004749", "23436043", "154174262", "25891268", "68012209", "166972183", "72877270", "31402994", "40209431", "36256253"], "inbound_citations": ["17421915", "54683225", "58951152", "29345385", "12150334", "1969122", "152818633", "55013452", "54821793", "109931400", "17688191", "46004726", "16169989", "11786324", "168456184"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18838501"}

Powerful new analytical tools and high-resolution environmental data can clarify trade-offs between engineering and environmental goals and can enable governments and funding institutions to compare alternative sites for dam building. Current site-specific assessment protocols largely ignore cumulative impacts on hydrology and ecosystem services as ever more dams are constructed within a watershed ( 1 ). To achieve true sustainability, assessments of new projects must go beyond local impacts by accounting for synergies with existing dams, as well as land cover changes and likely climatic shifts ( 2 , 3 ).

A special type of barrier is carbon lock-in, defined as a process whereby various forms of increasing returns to adoption inhibit innovation and the competitiveness of low-carbon alternatives, resulting in further path dependency. Here, we explore potential carbon lock-in in the Dutch chemical industry via semi-structured interviews with eleven key actors. We find that carbon lock-in may be the result of (i) technological incompatibility between deep emission reduction options over time, (ii) system integration in chemical clusters, (iii) increasing sunk costs as firms continue to invest in incremental improvements in incumbent installations, (iv) governmental policy inconsistency between targets for energy efficiency and deep emission reductions, and (v) existing safety routines and standards. We also identify barriers that do not have the self-reinforcing character of lock-in, but do inhibit deep emission reductions. Examples include high operating costs of low-carbon options and low risk acceptance by capital providers and shareholders. Rooted in the Dutch policy setting, we discuss policy responses for avoiding carbon lock-in and overcoming barriers based on the interviews, such as transition plans for individual industries and infrastructure subsidies.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.erss.2019.101320", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy research and social science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2980348141", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["53329258", "55631187", "44681088", "166841436", "158340092", "156063983", "55086822", "155053229", "16354625", "154844287", "53968815", "154421432", "114426649", "154312515", "54918772", "153794917", "152992948", "159010800", "13703331", "153816520", "14701754", "153605822", "3714870", "154750664", "155074685", "56031436", "154860619", "154313945", "127798671", "153629093", "130969039", "156225847", "154389567", "157099137", "152467461", "49398214", "197777708", "158897959"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204897382"}

This study verifies that when audit risk and business risk are considered simultaneously, the effect of audit risk on audit fees and hours diminishes with lower business risk.

Also a menu of contracts with a first-to-default basket and a credit default swap conditioned to the default of the first asset, can be used as a signalling device.

With the world facing the largest and most synchronized plunge in output of the postwar era, policy makers banded together to find solutions. This paper looks at the lessons from what did \u2014 and did not \u2014 occur in the area of policy cooperation since the crisis. Outcomes seem to be weaker over time in areas such as macroeconomic policies, where institutional procedures were less well defined and there were disagreements over spillovers. By contrast, cooperation seems to have been most effective where there was a consensus that such policies could avoid the risk of highly detrimental outcomes and institutional arrangements were more concrete. Principle amongst these was trade, but bank capital buffers, IMF resources, and derivatives exchanges also fall into this category. Lessons for those interested in promoting cooperation seems to be: it may be more fruitful to: focus on the potential for major costs from a lack of cooperation, rather than the minor gains from fuller coordination; strive for more consensus estimated spillovers; convince policy-makers costs of loss of cooperation are large; and focus on building better and more enduring institutional arrangements.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5089/9781498375764.001", "venue": null, "journal": "IMF Working Papers", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1982561237", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["198856974", "198805124", "155742839", "153826561", "153770740", "2247258", "153364092"], "inbound_citations": ["169666525", "154975734"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167330332"}

Spatial interaction models rely on the presence of an externality from local budget making, that is external effects originate from inter-jurisdictional resource flows due to tax competition for a mobile base, or from local public expenditure spillovers into neighboring jurisdictions. Similarly, the intergovernmental grants competition exists when there is a rivalry among local governments to get them from central government. This paper attempted to identify how great the fiscal competition among local governments in Indonesia. Using spatial statistics, we concluded that the fiscal competition among municipalities was greater compared to the pre fiscal decentralization period. It seems that the local tax setting and expenditures decisions in particular municipality can be attributed to the mimicking behavior to neighbor regions. Also, we found that the fiscal competition among municipalities could be attributed negatively to the fiscal disparity. Those imply that in the regional autonomy era the local governments tend to increase their local own revenue intensively and demand for intergovernmental grants in order to finance their expenditures.

Especially today's clear boundaries between private and public transportation systems will blur. Due to the possibility of an autonomous relocation of cars, car-sharing will become more relevant and compete the protected taxicab market in Germany. Private car ownership might even become redundant. Having these possible future circumstances in mind, we use a microscopic travel demand model to simulate the mode choice behaviour in a case study for the Stuttgart region: we presume a world without private cars and the presence of a large autonomous mobility on demand (AMOD) service instead. Following, under the assumption that up to four persons share a ride, we calculated the number of cars needed to run the AMOD service smoothly. We show that not all trips, previously made by private car, are substituted by the AMOD service; the modal share of walking, public transportation and bicycling is increasing as well. Due to lower cost of the AMOD service compared with car trips, trip lengths increase as well. The results show that about 45% of all vehicle movements and 20% of all vehicle kilometres could be saved. Furthermore, the results show that about 85% of all vehicles in the Stuttgart region might be dispensable.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.trpro.2017.07.004", "venue": null, "journal": "Transportation research procedia", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2790765223,2591045740", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Business"], "outbound_citations": ["154218811", "13995725", "30550372", "16360506", "107916456", "109313078", "54752617", "108425343", "63838348", "37649343", "109709332", "7997747", "7004540", "30381042", "8366758"], "inbound_citations": ["54463740", "190000525", "207817534"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:114716796"}

It seeks to compare the outcomes of debt collection arbitrations to the outcomes of debt collection cases in court to help in evaluating arbitration as a means of resolving consumer disputes. The arbitration cases examined are debt collection cases administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) as part of its consumer arbitration docket, supplemented by cases brought by a single debt buyer as part of a consumer debt collection program administered by the AAA. The court cases examined are a sample of cases seeking collection of unpaid student loans in federal court and samples of debt collection cases from Oklahoma state courts and Virginia state courts. The Task Force focused on debt collection cases because debt collection cases tend to present relatively simple legal and factual issues and thus are relatively comparable in arbitration and in court. Key findings are the following: (1) Creditors prevailed less often (that is, consumers prevailed more often) in the arbitrations studied than in court; (2) creditor recovery rates in the arbitrations studied were lower than, or comparable to, creditor recovery rates in court; (3) the consumer response rates in the arbitrations studied did not appear to differ systematically from consumer response rates in court; and (4) the rate of other case dispositions (e.g., dismissals and settlements) did not appear to differ systematically between the arbitration and court cases studied. At a minimum, the findings should dispel the notion that high creditor win rates and recovery rates in debt collection arbitrations in and of themselves show that arbitration is biased in favor of businesses. Instead, high creditor win rates and recovery rates appear to be due to characteristics of debt collection cases rather than the venue - court or arbitration - in which those cases are resolved.

Under multi-pricing, full information, and full control over the seeding process, with both multiplicative and additive forms of network effects, we show that all segments contain only paying customers except the first one, which contains both seeded and paying customers; and segments are opened in order of the customer valuation. Further, the seller\u2019s optimal strategy is socially optimal. Under single-pricing and limited seeding control, worst case seeding (where all seeds go to the high-valuation customers) leads to higher social welfare and consumer surplus than uniform seeding, as the former covers a larger portion of the market while charging a lower price.

These impacts on the level and composition of employment were significantly stronger in countries with stronger legal protection of permanent workers from dismissal.

In this line, attention to change and transformation is one of the affecting factors on the growth of productivity in organizations, especially in hospitals. ::: ::: ::: AIM ::: To examine the effect of transformational leadership on the productivity of employees in teaching hospitals affiliated to Iran University of Medical Sciences. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 254 participants from educational and medical centers affiliated to Iran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, Iran) in 2016. The standard questionnaires of Bass & Avolio and of Hersi & Goldsmith were used to respectively assess transformational leadership and level of productivity. The research assumptions were tested in a significance level of 0.05 by applying descriptive statistics and structural equations modeling (SEM) using SPSS 19 and Amos 24. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Results of the fitting indicators of the assessing model after amending includes Chi-square two to degrees of freedom of 2.756, CFI indicator 0.95, IFI indicator 0.92, Root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) indicator 0.10. These results indicate that the assessing model is well fitting after the amendment. Also, analysis of the model's assumptions and the final model of the research reveals the effect of transformational leadership on employees' productivity with a significance level of 0.83 (p=0.001). ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: This research indicates that the more the leadership and decision-making style in hospitals lean towards transformational mode, the more positive outcomes it brings among employees and the organization due to increased productivity. Therefore, it is essential to pay focused attention to training/educational programs in organizations to create and encourage transformational leadership behaviors which hopefully lead to more productive employees.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5614281", "pubmed_id": "28979731", "doi": "10.19082/4978", "venue": "Electronic physician", "journal": "Electronic physician", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2750518509", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Business"], "outbound_citations": ["153949872", "5281307", "25265548", "14974269", "143481681", "144499841", "167750227"], "inbound_citations": ["150792612"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:12468681"}

But while the booming telecommunications market opened doors for new growth in SouthAfrica and beyond, the new democracy also placed regulations aimed at advancing the goal of racial and socioeconomic transformation on all companies operating in the country. With the liberalization of mobile markets across Africa, investment opportunities for fast-moving local and international telecommunication companies have also opened up. This growth in telephony has been largely fuelled by mobile cellular communications firms, as well as foreign capital\u2019s drive to tap into new cellular markets. In 2003, revenues in the African mobile communications sector broke the US$10-billion barrier, with profits estimated at more than US$1 billion. (ITU 2004) The remarkable growth of telecommunications in the region has generated immense benefits for the operators (such as South Africa\u2019s MTN, France\u2019s Orange, Middle East\u2019s Celtel) and their major international suppliers of technology (such as Sweden\u2019s Ericsson, Germany\u2019s Siemens and China\u2019s Hua Wei). Key issues that confront the expansion of businesses from post-Apartheid South Africa are, firstly, the kind of impact South Africa\u2019s transformation is having in Africa through the expansion of foreign MNCs, and secondly, what can be learnt from this renewed economic engagement. Focusing on a single case study, this paper examines the way that the African expansion of Ericsson, a Swedish telecommunications multinational, has been shaped by post-Apartheid transformation imperatives in South Africa. Using SouthAfrica as a regional hub, Ericsson has expanded from SouthAfrica into the African telecommunications market. I chose to highlight this firm for several reasons: its major global market share as telecommunications infrastructure provider; its return to post-Apartheid South Africa after being forced to leave in the 1960s; its position as the leading provider of infrastructure for the South African \u2013 now PanAfrican \u2013 operator, MTN; and its fast-growing market share in the continent. It is my contention here that the story of Ericsson in post-Apartheid South Africa is illustrative of how MNCs are responding to South Africa\u2019s Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) strategy. The BBBEE objectives that characterize the postApartheid transition have affected the way this multinational operates in the continent. By looking at Ericsson\u2019s regional growth in post-Apartheid South Africa, my aim is 1", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.4314/asr.v12i1.43532", "venue": "African Sociological Review / Revue Africaine de Sociologie", "journal": "African Sociological Review / Revue Africaine de Sociologie", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2035496759", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["154758821", "3087303", "3087303", "203177422", "150907887"], "inbound_citations": ["55203676"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167342181"}

In the second phase, it assesses the ability of enterprises to commercialise industrial property rights and generate profits. Innovation performance then integrates both phases. In each industry, two samples were assessed: member enterprises of cluster organisations, and enterprises that operate in the same industry and region but are not members of a cluster organisation. The results of the research show that the existence of a cluster organisation has a greater effect on innovation performance in the traditional textile manufacturing industry. In contrast, in the new nanotechnology industry, the existence of a cluster organisation did not prove to have any significant effect on innovation effectiveness. In this industry, the existence of a cluster organisation had only a partial effect related to better industrial property rights commercialisation.

Considering the cross-platform externalities in payment processing, differentiated preferences for payment platforms, and competitive bottleneck on the consumer side, we derive the following results. When only the entry of a vertically integrated (or end-to-end service) provider is allowed, either all merchants choose to multi-home or no entry occurs, regardless of the regulatory requirement. On the other hand, if the entry of a downstream-only (or front-end service) provider is possible, a partial multi-homing equilibrium result can emerge for some conditions under which the entry of an end-to-end service provider does not occur. In addition, due to the lowered entry cost, the overall welfare is greater when the entry of downstream-only service is possible although the entire increase in welfare goes to the entrant. Without regulation, however, the vertically integrated incumbent does not voluntarily provide the back-end service to the entrant when the merchant\u2019s benefit from the payments service is not sufficiently high.

Policy-based management provides policy control on network devices to achieve this objective. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) recommended a two-tiered policy-based management (PBM) architecture. This recommended design is based on Common Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). There are COPS policy outsourcing and provisioning models. LDAP is for storing and fetching policy rules. However, several fundamental limitations exist in the recommended design. System scalability and cross-vendor hardware compatibility are the obvious drawbacks. In this paper, we study the system performance of PBM through experiments. Consequently, improved multi-tiered policy-based management architecture is proposed, and it is known as a unified policy-based management (UPM). For this new design, there are several extensions introduced that offer system flexibility and scalability. Particularly, an intermediate entity between policy server and network routers, the Policy Enforcement Agent (PEA), is introduced. In this proposed architecture, by properly extending network protocols, by installing multi-vendor hardware modules on-the-fly, and hence by interpreting and translating request and decision messages at the agents, the architecture enables a dynamic Unified Information Model throughout the control portion of the design. The multi-tier architecture provides flexible and scalable system design, and it allows executions of policy rules with dynamic addition of new equipment during run-time. To complete the design, communication protocols between policy servers and agents are established that facilitate load sharing and balancing mechanism and improve the system scalability issue.

The results also indicate that allocations differ significantly with changes in investor-specific target rates.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.1724839", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1750950234", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["154778907", "16456550", "154856141", "167645789", "154757221", "153337865", "201347676", "167787312", "203352395", "73564934", "39140166", "154793381", "154075601", "18016814", "146801716", "154652959", "166764859", "154612777", "153974075", "150709576", "153945263", "153488614"], "inbound_citations": ["199535109"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:166736399"}

Firms face regulations at both the firm- and product-level and may comply with or evade either regulation. The model suggests that firm-level regulation directly causes informality by deterring firm registration. However, the product-level regulation has two effects: it directly drives product informality as evasion of product regulation leading to informality within the formal sector and indirectly deters firms from registering. Further, I demonstrate that the Gini coefficient and Herfindahl index can be implemented in multi-product firm models as revenue-based measures of product diversification. Contrary to the prediction of the commonly used product scope, the revenue-based measures indicate informal firms to be more diversified than formal firms.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2524656", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2289920970", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["147059247", "153318375", "1713247", "56378204", "13673256", "151153632", "153545319", "166309458", "2142617", "51793496", "195768645", "55425593", "14305582", "54944497", "145026126", "54169699", "154244855", "6102680", "7320641", "2024039", "167979075", "168115436", "13455361", "748596", "16539324", "166943991", "420209", "153437671", "17294815", "154145187", "154768611", "154415346", "166552027", "2696937", "1672004", "115140168", "345643", "154893284", "153628430", "56236066", "56060172", "14367103", "154047770", "31583527", "153735778", "7001460", "168185821", "18084013", "166309458"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167602965"}

This aspect allows us to notice various concerns, among which the most significant one is: for what reason has internal marketing not been receiving - at least with respect to periodic and national Administration congresses - the attention it deserves?

Tourism investments in Indonesia are mainly focused on the development of fully-integrated resort sites that help boost the construction of tourist facilities such as hotels and the development of the surrounding environment through social and cultural aspects. The total contribution of travel and tourism to GDP was IDR736.3 billion or 8.9% of GDP in 2012.

This article also provides evidence that these powerful learning outcomes are future-oriented, increasing the entrepreneur's level of entrepreneurial preparedness for further enterprising activities.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jbusvent.2010.06.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Business Venturing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1970017934", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["15549529", "154011767", "153756954", "57784585", "154803489", "153724408", "115133716", "35953523", "145331907", "151069546", "9067903", "143843187", "16141923", "145812197", "37225190", "45606437", "153888445", "15056667", "16451265", "144566086", "143850164", "59059777", "153371391", "166571337", "144755838", "28341773", "167517451", "154350936", "142575988", "145344457", "57831699", "55396735", "154737867", "145667726", "168889935", "154124939", "145533918", "154771542", "144952509", "146499042", "154945493", "167791714", "154948146", "154823352", "55254241", "146157179", "167910395", "154221238", "188751256", "33181687", "108241505", "16154933", "145067235", "154579873", "154694013", "36763887", "142765726", "156151826", "154179580", "145013954", "154877034", "152335228", "59133393", "167718267", "144364490", "154816415", "167900103", "144544776", "143062597", "143987471", "145482771", "54876307", "42807043", "156033208", "24221845", "144371093", "167055171", "369186", "144521519", "167925512", "143844473", "56349668", "147259477", "204363686", "143377453", "144196103", "154802303", "154447716", "143351276", "143882287", "12380385", "167629108", "143743717", "203373164", "155810245", "154541152", "154694896", "150528396", "37410010"], "inbound_citations": ["55611724", "149913861", "158941865", "59366672", "203327767", "168417980", "59400991", "55404550", "148849097", "158413252", "196055111", "59059448", "55467498", "145704503", "158504928", "114801929", "7759272", "42177207", "102493224", "55801586", "152051499", "52950844", "73541942", "215269869", "184488143", "148243687", "212657916", "1579102", "173993842", "5703791", "155532380", "145797608", "168048887", "168624240", "54605069", "55270850", "154415446", "143694870", "170070891", "56088937", "59443485", "199493757", "158341362", "157289008", "214881537", "81981045", "211696227", "51680610", "53331590", "167658673", "209504687", "3938323", "158663300", "201040534", "199471787", "198814361", "73534387", "144788297", "199278535", "213091581", "208781652", "211544889", "12000948", "158478415", "210957099", "154634766", "4690720", "54812921", "54599041", "167037762", "145203839", "199487312", "211787131", "195429909", "182598448", "158906500", "150618523", "43851188", "55219114", "142769147", "181684868", "59407849", "197713152", "199865977", "149518141", "214507586", "36226284", "56413748", "18867820", "168022621", "158763425", "54510776", "15882156", "210172085", "204963286", "158305339", "113771223", "158877618", "45006285", "67759618", "166867578", "52233191", "198671873", "146337146", "56292451", "147500665", "151226198", "158960267", "54721847", "113897517", "54681217", "200062976", "168834148", "73574019", "54897299", "215289415", "3592813", "210539434", "158361182", "4801355", "22361305", "54579442", "67829893", "155778135", "56223692", "11325642", "53690969", "56257356", "52110191", "150667366", "199288464", "215426970", "3404020", "189991354", "55772654", "114987820", "199499026", "53979765", "55088657", "153373797", "111250157", "123789432", "58888771", "156152814", "145186205", "204898974", "211093827", "169629569", "52022837", "55647484", "55314442", "35526420"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:62891972"}

The beneficial cost effects of services reforms extend to both large and small-to-medium sized corporations (SMEs), but the former tend to enjoy greater gains. This feature also manifests itself in international markets. We identify an input cost channel through which service regulations affect the volume of exports of large manufacturers, while the evidence of such channel is weaker for SMEs. Our estimates indicate that, from 1991 till 2007, large firms increased their volume of exports by an average of 22% as a result of the direct input cost effect of services reforms, such that the firms that benefited the most typically belonged to industries more dependent on service inputs. Furthermore, convergence to the \u201cbest practice\u201d regulatory framework in services would have raised exports at least by an additional 10%.

This paper analyzes an initiative of the company John Deere and its dealer AFGRI to promote smallholder mechanization in Zambia. The analysis focuses on the impact of this initiative on smallholder farmers who receive tractor services and on the demand for hired labor. The results of a Propensity Score Matching (PSM) analysis indicate that farmers who access tractor services for land preparation can almost double their income by cultivating a much larger share of the land that they own. The analysis also suggests that the increased income is used for children s education and for purchasing more food, but does not result in increased food diversity. The findings indicate that the demand for hired labor increases due to the expansion of the cultivated area and due to a shift from family labor, including that of children, to hired labor. Questions that require further investigation are identified, including strategies to increase the incentives of tractor owners to provide services to smallholders; and strategies to avoid new forms of dependency of agricultural laborers that may result from a shift in the timing of the labor demand.

Specifically, it was proposed that transformational leadership would have a positive effect on organizational innovation. Furthermore, this effect was proposed to be moderated by an innovation-supporting climate and support received from external organizations. These relationships were tested on 163 R&D personnel and managers of 43 micro- and small-sized Turkish entrepreneurial software development companies. The results confirmed the positive impact of transformational leadership on organizational innovation, which was measured with a market-oriented criterion developed specifically for developing countries and newly developing industries.

I show that the presence of asymmetric information may prevent countries from reaching a first-best agreement if this information asymmetry is too high. I propose a new channel to restore the feasibility of the first-best agreement: pre-play communication. By revealing its abatement cost through a certification agency in a pre-play communication stage, a country commits not to misreport this abatement cost during the negotiations of an agreement. Hence, following certification by at least one country, information asymmetry is reduced. Certification restores the feasibility of the first-best agreement except for intermediate levels of information asymmetry. For those levels, one country undergoing certification is not always sufficient to restore the feasibility of the first-best but it is impossible to find transfers between countries such that they both optimally accept to undergo certification.

The research has been conceived in two successive steps. The first of these is to discover the influence of selected factors on customer satisfaction. Amongst these were factors which not only sometimes clearly influenced customer satisfaction (factors of customer satisfaction), but also factors which clearly influenced other types of satisfaction which were then associated with customer satisfaction (personal characteristics). In the second step, mutual relationships between the two groups of factors is described. The research was carried out on a sample of firms in the food industry along with their end customers. Multiple regression and a hierarchical mixed-effect model with the appropriate statistical tests were used for modelling. From the results it emerges that only the factors of customer satisfaction (customer expectation, perceived quality and perceived value) have an effect on overall customer satisfaction. The influence of personal characteristics was not proven. However, a (weak) relationship was shown between some of the factors of customer satisfaction (perceived value, perceived quality, competitiveness and customer expectation) and a number of factors from the group of personal characteristics (financial capacity, level of optimism and level of planning).", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.7441/joc.2018.04.10", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Cryptology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2998009130,2909379498", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics", "Business"], "outbound_citations": ["168158203", "9915382", "167795563", "144182497", "144340689", "167830026", "51844439", "154663865", "150535165", "154057164", "145587240", "154671676", "108572091", "15414030", "167614323", "51681784", "88652585", "55471677", "40094327", "144024264", "15798165", "31207033", "144901618", "153844518", "167545990", "154858490", "154926423", "167943739", "143440316", "27208366", "144386981", "62254677", "167839682", "167396632", "56027499", "154414796", "167528767", "25514469", "143493570", "153363189", "145054763", "143738119", "16291762", "154695326"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:128093990"}

But short-term risk neutral default probabilities behave quite differently, implying that there are periods of market-wide changes in volatility that do not show in measures of average spreads.

And yet there has been a relative dearth of detailed evaluations of the effects of mergers and the effectiveness of merger policy. In this book, John Kwoka, a noted authority on industrial organization, examines all reliable empirical studies of the effect of specific mergers and develops entirely new information about the policies and remedies of antitrust agencies regarding these mergers. Combined with data on outcomes, this policy information enables analysis of, and creates new insights into, mergers, merger policies, and the effectiveness of remedies in preventing anticompetitive outcomes. After an overview of mergers, merger policy, and a common approach to merger analysis, Kwoka offers a detailed analysis of the studied mergers, relevant policies, and chosen remedies. Kwoka finds, first and foremost, that most of the studied mergers resulted in competitive harm, usually in the form of higher product prices but also with respect to various non-price outcomes. Other important findings include the fact that joint ventures and code sharing arrangements do not result in such harm and that policies intended to remedy mergers -- especially conduct remedies -- are not generally effective in restraining price increases.

One of the mysterious corporate events which has attracted the attention of numerous researchers is a stock split. I perform the review of implications of splitting the stock for market liquidity of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and the Vienna Stock Exchange. I use event study, in particular Market model method and Market adjusted return method, to inspect the behavior of abnormal changes in daily trading volume for stock splits performed between 2000 through 2011 over a short run and assuming a longer time interval. Moreover, I juxtapose the results for both stock exchanges to examine whether the stock split phenomenon for two major capital markets from this part of Europe can be better explained by means of existing theories on stock splits. The research is aimed at analyzing the implications of the split for market liquidity, i.e. whether there occurs an immediate effect following the split as well as whether this corporate event improves the level of market liquidity over long run. Furthermore, the goal of the paper is to investigate whether the investors can cash in on the stock split, more specifically, whether they can profit from lower transaction costs. I document a significant growth in the market liquidity of stock splitting firms over 36 months following the split for both capital markets what is indicative of lower transaction costs for investors.

Estimations with instrumental variables show that imitation is an effect, and probably also a cause, of the network structure.

Placement of wind turbines has prompted public concerns related to their effects on wildlife and scenic views (U.S. Department of Energy (U.S. DOE) 2015, for a review, see Ladenburg 2009). This has been especially relevant in coastal areas, where the proposed development of large offshore wind energy facilities in states including Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia, and Oregon have been seen as a potential threat to the tourism industry. The response from the tourism industry has delayed or even blocked development of offshore wind facilities in some of these states. Literature surrounding economic effects on residents of wind turbines has mostly focused on residential property values through hedonic value studies focusing on the relationship between property price and turbine density (Sterzinger, Beck, and Kostiuk 2003, Poletti 2005, Heintzelman and Tuttle 2012, Lang, Opaluch, and Sfinarolakis 2014, Gibbons 2015). The values of beach community residents, however, may be different from the values of tourists visiting those communities. Other research has used stated-preference methods to measure preferences for reduction in the effects of offshore wind turbines (Gee 2010, Krueger, Parsons, and Firestone 2011, Landry et al. 2012, Parsons et al. 2016), or preferences for offshore turbines relative to other renewables (Ladenburg 2014). Recently, researchers have started to use choice experiments to access how wind farms influence individual preferences (Lutzeyer, Phaneuf, and Taylor 2016). This study uses an economic field experiment using actual beach visitors as research participants.Participants were offered an opportunity to bid on chances to win hotel rooms in a beach resort town. Participants bid on rooms of differing quality and location. We worked with private hotel owners to offer rooms in our experiment as either having wind turbine views or not. This allowed us to obtain a measure of beach visitors' preferences for otherwise identical rooms, varying only the existence of wind turbine views from the room.We find a negative effect of turbine views on beach visitors' willingness to pay for hotel rooms, however this effect does not hold for all visitors. Indeed, a small portion of the sample were willing to pay a premium for turbine views. We were unable to find any evidence that these values varied either with distance or hotel quality.MethodsThis research uses a within-subject field experiment offering participants the opportunity to purchase a lottery for a weekend stay at one of several hotels in Lewes, Delaware, a popular coastal vacation community. Lewes has a large wind turbine that is visible from nearby hotels. This experiment estimated willingness to pay (WTP) for hotel rooms as a function of distance from the wind turbine and hotel quality measured by a common star rating. Specifically, WTP for the view of the wind turbine was isolated by offering rooms that were distinguished only by the presence or absence of a wind turbine view from the room. The question of interest is whether there is a significant WTP a premium or not for rooms without turbine views, and, for rooms with turbine views, if WTP is affected by the quality of the hotel or the distance from the turbine. Table 1 describes the full set of hypotheses.This experiment used the BDM mechanism (Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak 1964) to offer lotteries for six different hotel rooms. This mechanism is a type of auction commonly used in economic experiments to obtain a theoretically consistent measurement of participant value for an item by soliciting bids then randomly selecting a price. Bids below the price do not purchase the item; bids above the price purchase the item at the randomly selected price. The experiment was conducted during the summer on a ferry on the Lewes-Cape May Ferry traveling between the coastal vacation towns of Lewes, Delaware, and Cape May, New Jersey. \u2026", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1017/age.2017.18", "venue": null, "journal": "Agricultural and Resource Economics Review", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2740070219", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["26653830", "154461529"], "inbound_citations": ["13695021"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:168887279"}

Use of artificial colorants over natural ones has increased in modern world. Besides, it has also concerned on importance of toxicological studies. Acceptable daily intake (ADI) of different colorants will define the optimum level of coloring substances on food items. Molecular size of coloring agents and their absorption ratio have significant role in toxico-kinetics. Bigger molecular size has lower absorption capacity and toxicity while vice versa for the smaller one. Higher absorption of smaller molecules can be lowered by binding with carrier molecules to make big enough to block through mucosal layer. Adverse health effects related to many colorants are itching, urticaria, anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity, intolerance reactions, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, cytostaticity and cytotoxicity. Color additives seem to be complex subject having direct relationship with consumer safety. Therefore, toxicology of attractive coloring agents might overlook the advantages of colorants. So, toxicologist and food scientist need to collaborate to define the use of different color additives and their safety in future in more scientific way.

To do this, survey was conducted for consumers in large cities, Seoul, Busan, and Daegu to observe their purchasing behavior and satisfaction both for packaged and unpackaged apple. Survey was focused to how they are satisfied with several attributes of package such as size, appearance, content, material, and label. On the basis of the survey results, the values of the package attributes were estimated. Survey results show that consumers tend to buy unpackaged apple rather than packaged apple. About 34 percent out of 313 respondents have ever purchased apple packed with paper box while only 10.5 percent have an experience to buy packaged apple with transparent box. Most respondents answered they preferred the package of five to six apples and 1.3 kilograms most. They preferred mid or large size apple. Estimation of the values of the package attributes using the conjoint analysis shows that consumers are giving the highest value to the price of packing material. It means that consumers are reluctant to the extra payment resulted from packing the apple. Therefore, the efforts to reduce the cost of packing apple should be made steadily. In order to vitalize the distribution of small packaged apple, the package should contain high quality apple with high sugar content, proper size, good appearance, and so on. And it needs to be promoted to the consumers that small packaged apple are not inferior to apple packed with paper box.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.7744/cnujas.2012.39.1.151", "venue": null, "journal": "Korean Journal of Agricultural Science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2093908201", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167657059"}

Methodology: Total freight flows are projected through the gravity modelling of a geographically disaggregated input\u2013output model. Three modal shift scenarios, defined over a 15-year forecast period, combined with road efficiency improvements, inform the heavy goods vehicle fleet for different vehicle types to serve the estimated future road freight transport demand. Findings: The largest portion of South Africa\u2019s high and growing transport demand will remain on long-distance road corridors. The impact can be moderated through the concurrent introduction of domestic intermodal solutions, performance-based standards in road freight transport and improved vehicle utilisation. This presupposes the prioritisation of collaborative initiatives between government, freight owners and logistics service providers. Research limitations: (1) The impact of short-distance urban movements on fleet numbers is not included yet. (2) Seasonality, which negatively influences bi-directional flows, is not taken into account owing to the annual nature of the macroeconomic data. (3) The methodology can be applied to other countries; the input data are however country-specific and findings can therefore not be generalised. (4) The future possibility of a reduction in absolute transport demand through, for example, reshoring have not been modelled yet. Practical implications: Provides impetus for the implementation of domestic intermodal solutions and road freight performance-based standards to mitigate the impact of growing freight transport demand.

The results showed that there is a significant relationship between financial reporting disclosures and financial performance except in the case of percentage of value added retained for expansion size where there was no significant relationship found.

Adopting a broad-market approach to the problem enables us to transform conventional theorizing - which suggests that property rights in inside information must be allocated within the firm, either to shareholders or to managers - and present a third, superior option: allocating the property right to market analysts. This new conceptualization of the problem enables one to see that the crucial issue underlying insider trading policy is: which group-insiders or market analysts can best provide efficiency and liquidity to financial markets?We argue, contrary to the accepted lore, that market analysts are superior to insiders in providing efficiency and liquidity to financial markets. Although insiders have ready access to inside information, they are isolated from external competition, and thus, if allowed to exploit this information through trade, they would seek to preserve and exploit their market power over inside information. Analysts, on the other hand, operate in a fiercely competitive environment, and, thus, process new information to the market as expeditiously as possible. Furthermore, because analysts possess greater financial resources, are able to diversify their investments, and frequently diverge in assessing stock prices, they also provide superior liquidity to financial markets.Moreover, we show, for the first time, that competition among analysts generates a myriad of positive externalities for the economy. Competition among analysts is responsible for the burgeoning market for financial information, and the welter of financial media to which we are exposed. In addition, the analysts' market creates economies of scale for the investment banking industry as a result of continuous monitoring and pricing of stocks, attracting many foreign companies to list their shares on U.S. capital markets. None of this would occur if insiders were allowed to trade. Because of their ready access to inside information, insiders would consistently beat analysts when competing against them, eventually driving analysts out of the market. Given the substantial benefits derived from competition among analysts, we submit that insiders should be banned from appropriating inside information; or as we suggest, they should be assigned, what we call, a negative property right in inside information to allow a competitive information market to develop. We believe that the novel theorizing we develop presents a compelling economic case for retaining the prohibition on insider trading.Finally, our broad market analysis provides a comprehensive analytic framework for analyzing the efficiency tradeoffs implicated by two unresolved aspects of insider trading: selective disclosure and warehousing.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.242912", "venue": null, "journal": "Virginia Law Review", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1529633630,2952742329", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics", "Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["26245256", "167733906", "16225244", "56342073", "59930134", "59355069"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:152786924"}

In a unique sample of US firms that have existed for over 25 years we find management confidence, as proxied by University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, is highly significant in explaining firm financing decisions. When management confidence is higher firms have higher levels of debt. This result is robust to different definitions of leverage and confidence as well as different model specifications. This confirms the theoretical arguments in behavioural finance that overconfident managers will tend to issue more debt. Market-to-book is found to be a significant determinant of capital structure as documented by previous studies. It is likely that this is due to market timing rather than growth opportunities as the sample of firms used in this study are not expected to be growth firms. In addition, this study provides additional evidence that timing of equity issues is not persistent as documented by Baker and Wurgler (2002). The lack of significance in persistence of timing of equity issues in the sample of firms indirectly supports the results of Hovakimian (2005), that the measure is a proxy for growth opportunities.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.791924", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2157787443", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["153338597", "15158714", "2600190", "10657357", "208369599", "14970192", "166403653", "7904484", "1808264", "19024037", "154535928", "153581884", "167475326", "426008", "53399844", "17038996", "53678924"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:168050446"}

Training objects scope is small Understands through interviews of management personnel, the company training new employees is the main object, and long working hours and the professional knowledge have a deep need of employees and the company management personnel are not included in the scope of training. 2). the training schedule is not reasonable accounted for only 33% of employees feel company training time arrangement is reasonable, and 67% of people think that the training time arrangements and unreasonable. Through the interview with the manager and employee, training schedule problems include two aspects: (1). the whole training time is shorter. Training content arrangement is more, and each training time in just five days or so, in the end of the training, business leaders will address, probably take up 1/4 of the training time, cause the unnecessary waste of time. A few days time, employees cannot learn substantial content. (2). the specific time training arrangement is not reasonable. Training arrangement of time is on Saturday and Sunday, Monday to Friday to go to work in the company. Down during the period of training, the whole week, employees have almost no time to personal disposable, the serious influence to participate in training the enthusiasm. 3 PERFECT THE CONSIBOT CO., LTD., THE CONCRETE MEASURES OF STAFF TRAINING PROBLEM 3.1 To do a good job of training demand analysis First of all, managers should first change training idea, realized that not only is the staff need training, enterprise management knowledge and management skills of high and low, for the direction of the enterprise plays a more important role. So the training object should not be confined to the grassroots staff, senior members of the staff and enterprise need to continue education should accept more relevant training. 3.2 reasonable training plans Arrange training time Now the company training time in about five days, and will arrange the training content is more, should increase staff training time to arrange a more reasonable training plan, to 12 days, for example, the front to relate the theoretical knowledge, a few days later a few days can give employees in the factory process of actual operation, this can let employees accept specific procedures, upon completion of the training work at the same time, also improve the quality of the training better. Each training time is on Saturday, should give staff arrangement of spare time in the weekend, for their freedom. Can change the training to the time, that is, the date to the date, but not every time training is conducted at the weekend. Holdings to change the training site In noise larger factories, which seriously affects the quality of learning? If is the classroom type training company should arrange a relatively quiet and comfortable teaching environment, can be in outside rent a house or choose management as a training base in the home. 3.3 to organize and implement do systemic training He will strengthen training pertinence Don't post staff specific needs, training content can be according to the result of employee training demand analysis and trainers, jointly by the company employees to make recommendations on the content of the training can be at the same time, in the direction of the company to grasp the teaching better meet the demand of staff training at the same time, enhance the pertinence of the training content, improve the quality of staff training. 3.4 Adopt various training methods, strengthen the training of flexibility CONSIBOT company adopts force-feeding teaching, this way of training is hard to adapt to the", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2991/ssemse-15.2015.60", "venue": "Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Social Science, Education Management and Sports Education", "journal": "Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Social Science, Education Management and Sports Education", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2312626045", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167570696"}

With 75% of the world\u2019s poor living in rural areas, the topic of improved agriculture through agricultural extension is viewed as central to poverty reduction. There have been questions posed by stakeholders (communities, policy-makers and politicians) about the non-visibility and accountability of agricultural extension in the communities that it is supposed to help. There are however a number of factors (perceived or real) that make agricultural extension less or not visible nor accountable. Therefore, this paper investigates and proposes a theoretical framework or model to ensure that agricultural extension is visible and accountable to all stakeholders.

Mesopotamia, China, Egypt and Rome are some examples. Fertile lands, transportation and water supply were main factors. During the industrial revolution, however, stormwater started to be considered as a great matter for urban life. Urban floods started to increase in magnitude and frequency. Street gutters were used to convey stormwater and wastewater as well. Diseases spread around the industrial city and waters had to be discharged as faster as possible. As a consequence, urban drainage started to play an important role in cities life. It is possible to say that urbanisation is an inexorable trend. The urban population has been increasing significantly in the last two centuries, since industrial revolution took place. The consequences of this process incurs in great changes of the natural environment. Urbanisation process tends to substitute natural vegetation for impervious surfaces, thus reducing infiltration. It also tends to eliminate natural detention ponds, to rectify river courses, among other actions, that greatly interfere with superficial flows. In general, floods in urban areas present greater runoff volumes and flow velocities, resulting in higher flow peaks and water stages. This way, urbanisation aggravates floods and, as it could be seen in cities development, it was not always possible to accomplish urban growing with the adequate infrastructure, especially in developing and poor countries. Even in wealthy countries, urban growth stresses the existing infrastructure. Urban floods disrupts social systems and cause significant economic losses. Among the impacts produced, there are health hazards and losses of human lives, flooding of housing, commercial and industrial properties, flooding of streets and intersections, causing traffic delays, disruption of services such as water supply, power supply and sewerage. Flood control is, thus, one of the major issues with which urban planners must deal nowadays, once floods play a dramatic role in the cities. Additionally, the lack of planning frequently worsens this situation. Many times, the absence of systemic design tools capable to represent the problem in an integrated approach leads to a decision process in which local solutions may be inadequate for the whole system needs. An important tool to be considered refers to the mathematical modelling of hydrologic and hydraulic processes. 10", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5772/9574", "venue": "Methods and Techniques in Urban Engineering", "journal": "Methods and Techniques in Urban Engineering", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1580275995", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["132643619", "129063820", "126984286", "113135659", "132336523", "128368249", "110690084", "128451103", "130708320"], "inbound_citations": ["67783301", "129981042", "55274217", "53076838", "198420333", "10717741", "197678302"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:143427952"}

Firstly, a larger presence of other firms implies more competition and thus lowers the earnings prospects of new entrants. Secondly, there might be positive spill-over effects between the activities of new and old entrants, which can lead to clustering effects. Such clustering of firms in foreign markets has been documented in the empirical literature on foreign direct investment (FDI) of nonfinancial firms, but little evidence is available for banks. This paper analyses whether banks have a tendency to cluster abroad and whether smaller banks in particular invest in markets where other banks are already present. We use firm-level evidence on the foreign direct investments of German banks for the period 1997-2000 to test this hypothesis. Our results suggest that German banks are indeed more active in markets in which other German banks are already present.

Design/methodology/approach - The data is generated by a large-scale postal questionnaire which was informed by preliminary interviews. Further interviews were carried out to aid interpretation of the responses. Descriptive statistics on the importance and frequency of use of individual practices provide the basis for discussion.Findings - Direct costing is widely practiced and important, by contrast with activity-based costing and full absorption costing. Despite the limitations of conventional budgets, they remain a central management accounting 'pillar' and are frequently used in 'what if?' analyzes. The balanced scorecard and other non-financial performance measures are perceived to be important but never or rarely used by 40% of companies. Product profitability analyzes are frequently applied, and, surprisingly, the profitability of supplying individual customers is frequently calculated by over 50% of the population. Respondents were skeptical about sophisticated DCF investment appraisals.Practical implications - Traditional management accounting is 'alive and well' but there are indications of likely increased use of: information concerning the cost of quality; non-financial measures relating to employees and analyzes of competitors' strengths and weaknesses. There is evidence of a gap between current textbooks and actual practices.Originality/value - The survey provides a unique detailed examination of actual management accounting practices and an indication of future trends.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1108/00070700610661321", "venue": null, "journal": "British Food Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2131702330", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["153676026", "27554084", "166418953", "154090210", "153858345", "154999116", "154293755", "153325795", "154678313", "153771598", "154175638", "166562417", "153868710", "168004907", "151305933", "154287202", "142933508", "154300228", "167584809", "167864594", "167441021", "154884620", "166975869", "153641126", "154251695", "154791332", "167299489", "167538942", "153923727", "154442798", "167910509", "150935301", "15187184", "167167052", "167827182", "154362252", "153568593", "154028706", "154424097", "167056610", "167400545", "166370483", "154344412", "154648365", "167436127", "37737084", "167805173", "166998283", "166521180", "150800955", "149499807", "53793536", "154931638", "150779385"], "inbound_citations": ["55592654", "55410644", "164300132", "167831471", "201428437", "54091914", "14973223", "54731057", "54719062", "54904302", "54956364", "55771587", "52025140", "80782559", "54578964", "55379291", "199875159", "55420027", "169967948", "168679986", "54980123", "56458483", "40780620", "73562010", "55995316", "191899741", "56105143", "55707421", "168324094", "198951827", "54622720", "169528522", "73575388", "54946961", "169978266", "168995992", "201757250", "169026904", "54608069", "211163112", "155057013", "199319761", "56435987", "167934850", "167642382", "199279472", "212714177"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:58894964"}

Using a unique database of UK innovations linked to innovative firms, the empirical analysis highlights the many ways that firms can alleviate information asymmetries and the constraints imposed by collaborative innovation without taking recourse to trademarks. When information asymmetries are not at stake, i.e. when firms use an already existing trademark for their innovations or when they use intermediaries for its distribution, trademarks no longer serve their purpose, leading firms to avoid using it for their innovations. Open innovation also decreases the incentive to trademark, especially when the innovative process involves users, mainly because of property rights issues or because the innovator prefers to use the clients\u2019 own distribution channels.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/13662716.2019.1616533", "venue": null, "journal": "Industry and Innovation", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2922994291,2953179061", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics", "Business"], "outbound_citations": ["154762808", "18607335", "111383618", "55727317", "154731216", "159141795", "878913", "37551309", "154956085", "54802759", "54592766", "153983174", "154094572", "154040137", "153547356", "55142969", "16219994", "166738435", "153854724", "153564873", "166915784"], "inbound_citations": ["213726833", "211397734"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:169964624"}

Finally, to investigate the role China plays in bringing down Annex I countries' compliance costs, we further broaden the market to include China into full global trading. Our results clearly demonstrate that the gain of the OECD as a whole increases as the market expands. Our results also show that developing countries themselves benefit from such an expansion too because it not only provides them for additional financial resources, but also helps to cut their baseline carbon emissions by a big margin. By contrast, the former Soviet Union tends to become worse off as the market expands.

It has the potential to contribute towards environmental protection and poverty reduction. Prior to investment in tourism, concerned authorities must know the condition of respective tourist resources, their attractiveness and levels of touristic demand. Very few studies in Nepal have made an effort to quantify the tourism potential in cultural, historical and religious sites such as Bhaktapur Durbar Square. With an objective to assess the tourism potential of Bhaktapur Durbar Square using Weighted Sum Method, this study was carried out from start of June to the end of July in 2013. For this purpose, questionnaire survey with tourists, private businesses and public sector institutions; focus group discussion and key informant interview with tourism enterpreneur and local government officer was carried out. The tourism potential was found to be high with a strength of exceptionally rich cultural, historical and religious heritage, favourable geographical situation, positive image of local Newari food products and friendly and welcoming local people. The areas of weaknesses were lack of tourism infrastructures and services, lack of tourist information and weak management of tourist area. Hence, to utilise the tourism potential of Bhaktapur Durbar Square to the fullest for the economic upliftment of its inhabitants, promotional activities such as tourism fairs, festivals, cultural dances and events should be conducted at regular intervals with prompt security services.

In this paper, we explore the possibility of producing aggregated estimates of technology availability by constructing an index of technology availability in hospitals. Our index is based on the number of services provided by a hospital, weighted by how rare those services are. We use the index to examine the relationship between managed care and technology availability in hospitals. We find that managed care may have slowed technology growth in the mid 1980s, but in the early 1990s we find little evidence that technology growth in areas with high-HMO market share is any slower than growth in lower market share areas. To the extent that our index captures variation in the costs of new technologies, this finding leaves open the question of whether managed care can help control long term cost growth by slowing technology adoption. We also discuss the general strengths and weaknesses of indices of the type we develop. One concern arises from the considerable variation across individual technologies. We profile several individual technologies and note that conclusions drawn from the aggregated index may not apply to each of the constituent technologies. Nonetheless, this exercise shows that it is feasible to develop and analyze hospital technology indices if aggregated information about technologies is appropriate to the research question.", "year": 1999, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3386/w6894", "venue": null, "journal": "National Bureau of Economic Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1579824881", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["9930082", "10275214", "33504643", "22015322", "46386501", "155127741", "153613431", "154382470", "43405436", "167594952", "155453361", "27019764", "154784903", "19244643", "44983942", "28196479", "40119131", "28993477", "152408219", "40984872", "13401364"], "inbound_citations": ["605738", "9982501", "13355646", "4443684", "18207243", "17284050", "36458208", "3915521", "1222579", "16216903"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:166298341"}

There are still many restrictions and contradictions, born of the particular institutional and political environment of the Russian oil industry at the end of fifteen years of transition, that act as a bar to international integration. Three factors currently define the establishment of relations with foreign investors. First, because of the many different levels of negotiation with Russian companies, the State and the Regions, the decisions are based on complex relations between the various forces. Second, the reforms, and especially privatisation and the allocation of rights of ownership to deposits, are considered by sizeable sections of public opinion and many political classes to be illegitimate, thus making the issue of international investment and foreign presence still more complicated. Finally, the State's wish to take back the oil industry in order to use it to fulfil its economic and foreign policies is creating further uncertainty. These three elements seriously restrict the entry of international oil companies to the Russian market.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.enpol.2004.09.007", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy Policy", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2238900951,2083070437", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["8248753", "166688080", "153892951"], "inbound_citations": ["154687623", "30909203", "85526273", "198806215", "55505429", "14590603", "157309030", "16847285", "214637673", "154076767", "182681671", "53422731", "55487064", "154103981"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1246963"}

However, empirical evidence about how service firms successfully offer novel and meaningful services is scarce, particularly in the context of business-to-business (B2B) service firms. Drawing on the B2B collaborative perspective and KBV, we aim to investigate when customer and supplier collaboration are more beneficial to drive service novelty and meaningfulness. Using data of 186 B2B service firms, the results reveal that collaboration with customers and suppliers are not equally beneficial to drive both novelty and meaningfulness and their outcomes can be amplified or lost under specific conditions. Customer collaboration is more beneficial to increase novelty in the presence of exploratory learning and employee collaboration. Contrary, supplier collaboration drives novelty only at higher levels of exploratory learning. Further, supplier collaboration is more beneficial to improve meaningfulness at higher levels of employee collaboration. Finally, the positive outcomes of both customer and supplier collaboration disappear in the presence of knowledge tacitness.

The study uses descriptive technique on primary data collected using interview and questionnaire from 12 towns distributed throughout the 6 administrative regions of the country. The approach adopted includes both a survey and structured interviews targeted at women who are active in the informal business sector. The main findings from the sample data of 1604 women collected indicate that majority of the respondents are poor as their monthly income hovers around the poverty line set by the world bank (of one dollar and fifteen cents per day). Furthermore, it has been noted that the greater part of women interviewed are active as petty traders, followed by services and only a minority of them are active in the manufacturing (production) sector. Poverty and unemployment are the two main driving forces that made them to try their chance by making themselves active in this sector. However, they lack the entire necessary infrastructure and amenities to facilitate their businesses as the majority of them work in open public places under continuous harassment and uncertainty. They do need legal and social protection, place of work, training, credit and other amenities if they are going to expand their business and go out poverty. The result shows the situation and plight of women in informal sector in the country and the paper therefore recommends that policy makers take notice of their situation and give more support and formulate policies that will provide an enabling environment for the growth, expansion and prosperity of the sector in general and women working in the sector in particular. ::: ::: Key words: Women, informal business, developing country, Eritrea.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5897/IJPDS2015.0243", "venue": "International Journal of Peace and Development Studies", "journal": "International Journal of Peace and Development Studies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2518258039", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["157440770", "153778023"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55938319"}

Better GPRA performance reporting is correlated with greater availability and use of several kinds of performance information by federal managers in the programs and operations they supervise. The results are statistically significant and relatively large. Correlations are especially significant for types of activities GPRA sought to encourage, such as output and outcome measures and use of performance information to allocate resources, set priorities, and develop measures and goals.

We build a simple model wherein banks interact via chains of repo contracts and use their proprietary collateral or re-use the collateral obtained by other banks via reverse repos. In this framework, we show that total collateral volume and its velocity are affected by characteristics of the network like the length of rehypothecation chains, the presence or not of chains having a cyclic structure, the direction of collateral flows, the density of the network. In addition, we show that structures where collateral flows are concentrated among few nodes (like in core-periphery networks) allow large increases in collateral volumes already with small network density. Furthermore, we introduce in the model collateral hoarding rates determined according to a Value-at-Risk (VaR) criterion, and we then study the emergence of collateral hoarding cascades in different networks. Our results highlight that network structures with highly concentrated collateral flows are also more exposed to large collateral hoarding cascades following local shocks.

As the transition is in progress, the nature of the government's policies are unknown to the agents. Property rights once held by the state have already been transferred to the agents, with each agent owning one firm. However, the agents are uncertain of the level of law enforcement the government will provide. Specifically, they are unsure of the tax and confiscation consequences of both legal and illegal acts. Each agent, having a different cost of stealing, must decide how much of the firm to divert to himself. The agents believe the government may become either a traditional democratic government that supplies law enforcement as well as infrastructure leading to positive firm growth, or a corrupt government that may or may not provide law enforcement, does not provide a climate for firm growth, and may be confiscatory. All agents presume the government will choose its behavior as a function of the tax revenue it will collect under each scenario; however, the tax revenue results from the collective decisions of the agents. This interaction between tax revenue and agents decisions, together with the uncertainty of law enforcement and tax policy, forms the framework within which the agent chooses his level of honesty. By calculating the percentage of agents who steal some amount from the firm, we investigate the relationship between the level of criminality and the various uncertainties facing the agents. We show how expectations of the agents about the future behavior of their government induce the degree of criminality in society.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.878451", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1717266270", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["154296807", "152442431", "8248753", "56326471", "55424064", "152824424"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:37778249"}

The results of this study indicate that differentiation through specialisation is the best strategy to develop the Niagara wine region.

Family financial planning is a practice that has been and continues to gain popularity even further and draw the attention of people worldwide. Financial concerns plaguing many people , not always arise from a lack of money but mostly by the lack of planning how to use the money. Although the number of financial planners continues to grow every day, in Albania there are still too many families who do not know the significance of the impact of a proper financial planning in their financial security for the future. Through this paper we aim to shed light on the key concepts related to financial planning, the importance of its role in the economic life of individuals and families , as well as raising the opportunities in its application.

This paper analyses the export-sales ratio of a sample of young technology-oriented firms in Germany and the UK. The empirical results confirm that neither youth nor smallness are necessarily an obstacle to realising a high degree of internationalisation.

For the most part, this literature has found that users innovate but do not commercialize their innovations. Instead, users benefit from using their innovations and allow manufacturers to commercialize innovations with financial value. Yet scholars have recently shown that entrepreneurial activity by users is more widespread than previously believed. We present data and statistics documenting the prevalence, technological impact, and economic impact of user entrepreneurship. Then, to reconcile these divergent empirical findings, we develop a theoretical model that explains when user innovations are commercialized by users, by manufacturers, or not commercialized at all. At the core of our model is the notion that users and manufacturers differ along two critical dimensions: their estimates of the financial returns to entering the product market, and their profit thresholds. Depending upon the magnitude of these differences, we propose alternative commercialization outcomes. This model helps to explain why user entrepreneurs are likely to spawn the creation of altogether new product markets and even industries. We illustrate our model with examples from the field of consumer sporting goods.

Waterfronts became more urbanised and commercialised from the early 1990\u2019s onwards. However, due to constraints such as ineffective governance as well as inadequate federal, state and municipal planning guidelines, the waterfronts have problems such as environmental degradation, crime and flooding. Although some waterfront development projects continue to remain profitable, with good public access, many do not.This paper examines the effectiveness of governance for waterfront developments in Malaysia. The data presented in this paper was obtained from in-depth interviews with stakeholders involved in waterfront development projects in Malaysia; in particular, from three selected case study areas: Kuching Riverfront, Malacca Waterfront and Glenmarie Cove Riverfront.

On the contrary, in developing countries particularly, the concept is one of the most ignored elements in evaluation of health care systems. Pakistan is also a case in point.

Public waste administrators are actors in a waste management system and are often involved in initiating community activities, making decision and implementing policies, which should benefit the communities and the environment. They help to facilitate recycling campaigns in the hope that this will increase awareness and prompt the public to practice sustainable waste management behaviour. However, studies conducted in Malaysia reveal that there is still low public participation in recycling, indifference of the public towards waste minimisation effort and no clear guidelines on effective ways for administrators to conduct effective people based approaches. The lack of enforcements for recycling is also perceived to contribute to the lack of participation from the public. However, this study finds that the administrators are more enthusiastic about school communities participating in recycling programmes as compared to recycling activities run by other volunteers in the community. Administrators perceive that recycling effort should be the responsibility of each individual but the lack of commitment from the public in general to participate, misuse of recycling infrastructure, financial constraints and the absence of proper guidelines hamper many programmes sustainability.

With heterogeneous costs, the number of firms surviving in equilibrium is quite insensitive to the market size.

Its aim is to identify relatively homogeneous groups of property appraisers taking into consideration the scope of services performed by them and the types of clients served. Based on the survey results, it was possible to indicate major models in property valuation services consistent with market applications, which allows us to verify the thesis on specialization in doing business in property valuation. The research strategy approach is twofold. Firstly, we have used the agglomerative cluster method to divide the types of valuation services and appraisers\u2019 clients in order to find groups of similar valuation services and represent the main models of business in property appraisals. Secondly, we have applied the k-means partition methods to find relatively homogenous groups of respondents, taking into account the frequency of carrying out the particular types of valuations and clients served. As a result of our research, we present four clusters combining valuations and client types which reflect the models of property valuers\u2019 professional activity, i.e: the market-oriented housing valuation model, market-oriented commercial valuation model, non-market-oriented judicial valuation model and non-market- oriented public valuation model.

However, consolidation of CHVs position within formal health systems has proved to be complex and continues to challenge countries, as they devise strategies to strengthen primary healthcare. Malawi\u2019s community health strategy, launched in 2017, is a novel attempt to harmonise the multiple health service structures at the community level and strengthen service delivery through a team-based approach. The core community health team (CHT) consists of health surveillance assistants (HSAs), clinicians, environmental health officers and CHVs. This paper reviews Malawi\u2019s strategy, with particular focus on the interface between HSAs, volunteers in community-based programmes and the community health team. Our analysis identified key challenges that may impede the strategy\u2019s implementation: (1) inadequate training, imbalance of skill sets within CHTs and unclear job descriptions for CHVs; (2) proposed community-level interventions require expansion of pre-existing roles for most CHT members; and (3) district authorities may face challenges meeting financial obligations and filling community-level positions. For effective implementation, attention and further deliberation is needed on the appropriate forms of CHV support, CHT composition with possibilities of co-opting trained CHVs from existing volunteer programmes into CHTs, review of CHT competencies and workload, strengthening coordination and communication across all community actors, and financing mechanisms.

In this paper, we have analyzed the risk of the micro-enterprises during the period 2004-2005, on a database that included 1401 companies. For this aim, we have used two specific instruments: a score function, for the estimation of the bankruptcy risk, and the degrees of leverage, for the assessment of the operating and financial risk. After making this study, we noticed that the micro-enterprises from the Dolj District have dealt with a risk augmentation in 2005, fact emphasized both by the decrease of the average score and by the augmentation of the weight of the bankrupt companies in the total number of analyzed enterprises. Also, the other drawn conclusion was linked with the lack of correlation between the Z score and the degrees of operating and financial leverage, due to the different foundations of these instruments in appreciating the risk dimension.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.1291909", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1586725730", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:166711138"}

In order to understand the house purchase decision; it is important to identify house buyers\u2019 demographic factors such as age, household composition, income etc. Such factors will initially influence buyers\u2019 decision to buy a house. By understanding the demographic background of buyers\u2019 real demand in the market for luxury condominiums could be identified by the developers. As well as luxury condominium is a type of product which is affordable to a very limited number of buyers as the price levels of the product is very high. So, real estate marketers and sales personals find it very difficult to find the prospective buyers for these apartments as there are no evidence about the demographic background of the people who demand these luxury condominiums. But if this information is available for them they would have a clear idea about the target group of the buyers so that they can do their particular marketing and promotional campaigns specially targeting them which will result in increased number of sales. Hence, the objective of this study is to identify the demographic background of potential buyers of luxury condominium apartments in Colombo. The population of the study is potential buyers who demand luxury condominium apartments in Colombo. The sampling method was judgmental sampling and the sample was considered as potential buyers who visited Astoria condominium apartment. Data was collected using questionnaire survey method and data analysis was done using SPSS software. House buying decision is a collective family decision even though the first phase of information collection and final phase of decision process dealing with payments and company is mostly done by males. It shows that mostly the purchase decision is a collective decision done with their family members. Major age categories of buyers are from30-50 years which confirms that this is the age that potential buyers make their purchase decision. Most of the respondents are Sri Lankans while there is a mix of other nationalities, and a higher portion of Sri Lankan potential buyers are living abroad. Majority of buyers\u2019 income lays in between (LKR) 1-5 million. Further, the majority of the respondents are well educated and are business owners while average household size of these respondents was 4 members.

While capital market development depends on many factors including, primarily, a favorable macroeconomic environment, an appropriately designed and effective legal and regulatory framework can help to encourage market growth and to increase access to finance for all companies, including small- and medium-sized enterprises. In this paper we identify the basic necessities that underpin a regulatory regime that is cost effective and strikes an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, laws and regulations that may be too restrictive to achieve a supply of capital and, on the other, those that may be so relaxed that investors feel that there is an unacceptable level of risk and do not care to venture into the market. We explore the legal foundations for the successful operation of a primary market for securities and identify disclosure and effective monitoring and enforcement as essential elements of legal protection. We then examine different legal and regulatory approaches for improving access to finance. We discuss measures that can be used by traditional stock exchanges to attract smaller enterprises to their lists as well as recent initiatives to create second boards or divide the main board into different market segments. We also discuss different mechanisms for companies to raise funds outside of a formal stock market listing, including private placements and private equity. Finally, we propose some recommendations for a simple legal and regulatory framework that will help promote access to primary equity markets, via both the traditional exchange as well as other alternatives.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1596/1813-9450-3892", "venue": "Policy Research Working Papers", "journal": "Policy Research Working Papers", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2160909970", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["6352989", "154673504", "55562537", "37880214", "32105454", "55326109", "157890362", "36874100", "12845964", "14321336", "11189943", "16437791", "16197645"], "inbound_citations": ["17162097", "55853097", "167830874", "8118386", "209483608"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:168002425"}

The traditional practice for delivering agricultural information has mainly relied on agricultural extension staff visiting farmers in order to provide advisory services. Due to the limited number of extension staff and other challenges, the delivery of agricultural extension services through the traditional farm and home visits has been ineffective. This paper presents challenges that the agricultural extension system in Lesotho faces, which necessitate the adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs) as a basis for improving access of farmers to extension services. The advent of ICTs has given rise to e-extension, which is the delivery of extension services using web tools that allow online sharing, collaboration and networking. A recent study has revealed that agricultural extension professionals in Lesotho recognize the potential and use of e-extension in the country and are well positioned to embrace its introduction. The paper, therefore, recommends that efforts should be made to gradually introduce e-extension in the country, capitalizing on the existing enthusiasm among extension professionals and lessons of best practice from elsewhere. ::: ::: Key words: Agricultural extension, e-extension, information and communication technology (ICT).", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5897/JAERD2019.1040", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Agricultural Extension and Rural Development", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2981737162", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["16141461", "60421512", "167448885", "13490192", "14271519", "11945907", "13265565", "55411783", "131614425", "142365310", "174774845", "169540871", "214654620"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:208008137"}

In the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) applicable rules are found in the Contract Law and the Company Law . Recent decades have seen a divergence in approaches in the common law world, with the common law retained in some jurisdictions and superseded by legislation in others. This has led to differences in the law, particularly with respect to the critical issue of under what circumstances 3 rd parties contracting with company representatives lose the right to assume that the representative has the authority they appear to have or, to state the issue differently, what level of knowledge or suspicion of irregularity a company should prove a 3 rd party has in order to avoid liability for the acts of the company\u2019s agent. These differences have significant implications for inter-jurisdictional contracts. This article examines the law in Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and the PRC and assesses the extent to which the rules in each jurisdiction satisfactorily balance the interests of companies and third parties and serve the interest of commercial convenience. It notes that the approaches in Singapore and Hong Kong, which both retain the common law, and in the PRC, which has independently developed almost identical rules, strike the appropriate balance between the rights of companies and 3 rd parties contracting with them, whereas statutory formulations in Australia and New Zealand do not.

It is based on the results of a French survey that describes shipments sent by firms accross the country. Its aim is to shed light on the organization of urban systems. While most of works on urban systems are focused on the most visible and obviously dominant cities, little attention has been devoted to the basis of urban hierarchies. The purpose of this paper is to help fill this void, by integrating higher and lower levels of urban hierarchy. In order to do this, freight flows are analyzed to understand what they highlight on the economic interactions between the urban centres. This research shows that the pattern of freight flows between urban areas in France is hierarchical, but varies depending upon whether the flows are generated by wholesale trade activities or by manufacturing. The differences are explained by the specific organizational characteristics of each of these two activities. Wholesale trade broadly reflects the traditional spatial organization of service activities, with interlocking areas of influence. The spatial organization of manufacturing flows is more complex, which can be attributed to the regional specialization of activities. it should be highlighted that many of the outputs of manufacturing are inputs for wholesale trade. The majority of manufacturing flows involve parts and semi-finished goods that are not distributed to the market but to other manufacturing units, or to large purchasers who then coordinate the distribution of these goods. The exception could be certain fresh food products (i.e. Dairy), which, in their final form (ready for consumption), have a market-based distribution structure, similar to wholesale trade.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rtbm.2013.12.001", "venue": null, "journal": "Research in transportation business and management", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1967248394,2952005161", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["6645956", "154414889", "155421646", "155498274", "143979624"], "inbound_citations": ["96451370", "133383572", "132869870", "56233039", "54091863", "153412227", "158723112", "129987233"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:42565775"}

Yet local officials often have difficulty in quantifying the demand for taxi service or tracking changes in demand. Multiple regression modeling of the number of cabs in 118 U.S. cities identifies three primary demand factors: the number of workers commuting by subway, the number of households with no vehicles available, and the number of airport taxi trips.

Using a sample of US financial institutions over the period 2003-2009 we document that CEOs with high equity incentives have systematically engaged in securitization transactions to a larger extent than CEOs with low incentives. We also show that CEOs with high equity and risk-related incentives have engaged in the securitization of risky loans and have used securitization for transferring risks to outside investors. Finally, we show that executives incentivized on risk have provided outside investors with low quality disclosure about losses recorded on securitized loans thus contributing to increase the opacity of securitization transactions undertaken. Overall, we interpret our results as evidence that CEOs have foreseen in securitizations under US GAAP an opportunity for hiding risks while bearing them and generating profits and cash flows because of the risks.

By all accounts the providers in this market are working in a growth industry. In the short term this is bad news for those concerned with tax policy and information privacy. In the long term however, the fight against technology-assisted fraud is stimulating the development of a more robust technology base within tax administrations, and this is good news for those who believe that a sophisticated technological infrastructure is needed to resolve difficult questions of tax design. This paper focuses on two technology-accelerants of SME tax fraud - zappers and phantom-ware. Zappers and phantom-ware are programs that are added-on (zappers) or factory installed (phantom-ware) to modern ECRs or point-of-sale (POS) systems. Some programs (zappers) have no legitimate purpose other than to facilitate cash skimming at the point-of-sale. Others programs (phantom-ware) may have legitimate (non-fraud) purposes, although these purposes are somewhat obscure (remote from normal business uses). Phantom-ware programs are frequently hidden (in the sense of not being disclosed in user manuals), making their use and even their existence difficult to detect on audit. With training a fraudster can skim cash receipts with phantom-ware as effectively as with a zapper. The range of technology-regulation being considered by governments in response to these frauds stretches from the development of a centralized data-base to collect and retain all records of all retail sales in a jurisdiction; to mandatory government certification of each and every ECR in use in a jurisdiction; to direct encryption by the government of the raw transactional data passing through an ECR or POS system - without regard for the background system that generates it - a solution that has seen both market-segment and a whole-market permutations; to voluntary third-party encryption and third-party certification of ECRs. There are of course advocates for minimal regulation and traditional audit-enforcement, admittedly with significant enhanced technology training. The audit approach is most effective when there is authority to perform comprehensive audits - a simultaneous examination of all relevant taxes (income, consumption, and welfare levies). One of the anomalies of this research is that there are very few reported cases of phantom-ware and zappers used in American to skim cash sales. What accounts for this omission? There are two places to look for the answer: (1) relative tax rates - maybe the American tax rates are significantly different from those in the EU and Canada, and as a result there is no incentive to skim cash sales in America; or (2) enforcement efforts - maybe the American tax enforcement efforts are significantly different, and as a result we do not pick-up on all the technology-assisted fraud that is going on. This paper suggests the problem is in the American enforcement regime.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.1139826", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1588485214", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["159994008"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167081795"}

The results confirmed previous international studies that market orientation is significantly and positively related to financial performance. This means that the SME leader should pay closer attention to collect information and create market intelligence pertaining to current and future customer needs, to disseminate this intelligence across departments and to respond to it organization-wide. Leadership style was determined based on the Harris and Ogbonna (2001) scale. Our results indicated that a participating and supportive management style leads to higher market orientation.

Building upon Grossman and Hart's model of incomplete contracts, we show that a regime that trades a reduction in post-issuance litigation uncertainty for a complete prior art disclosure maximizes social welfare because it benefits both the patentee and the PTO. The patentee favorably views the reduction in litigation uncertainty and greater control over the possibility of the public's perspective, a fuller prior art disclosure may allow the PTO to grant patent rights commensurate with innovation and to avoid the detrimental consequences of an overbroad patent grant. In sum, this proposal is an incentive-capatible trade that maximizes joint social surplus. The optimal policy for high technology inventions (characterized by asymmetric information and high productivity effects) provides incentives for well-informed patentees to reveal information regarding the relevant prior art to the PTO during patent prosecution. This is consonant with a body of contracting literature that proposes that when parties are asymmetrically informed, default rules that penalize the more informed party will be welfare-enhancing by inducing that party to reveal information. However, in our case, we do not impose a penalty on the better-informed party, the patentee. Rather, we permit a transfer of ex post bargaining rights (i.e., reduce the public's residual right to invalidate the patent) in order to induce the better-informed party to reduce the informational asymmetry between the patentee and the PTO.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.264011", "venue": null, "journal": "Washington University Journal of Law and Policy", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2950274105,2122708451", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["154255799", "94076775", "9721117", "9296557", "18968797", "199367962"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:154626892"}

The first group should be governed by default rules crafted against the interest of management and of controlling shareholders, because these are more efficient on average and/or easier to opt out of when they are or become inefficient for the particular company. The second set of companies should instead be governed by default rules matching the status quo even if this favors the incumbents. This regulatory dualism strategy is intended to overcome the resistance of vested interests towards efficient regulatory change. Appropriate menu rules should be available to both groups of companies in order to ease opt-out of unfit defaults. Finally, we argue that European takeover law should be reshaped along these lines. Particularly, the board neutrality rule and the mandatory bid rule should become defaults that only individual companies, rather than member states, can opt out of. The overhauled Takeover Directive should also include menu rules, for instance a poison pill defense and a time-based breakthrough rule.

This paper emphasizes a structured dialogue with desicion-makers at national, regional and local levels, aimed at identifying what decision-makers really need to decide and the key barriers to the implementation of existing urban sustainability tools. This study was organized in four discrete steps. Initially, what EU urban sustainability projects can deliver (studies, methodologies, tools, policies, etc.) was identified. The deliverables were evaluated against certain criteria and categorized into cross-cutting aspects (territorial management and urban design, social and economic cohesion) and sectorial aspects (sustainable mobility, energy efficiency).

The study covered 429 women respondents who had access to microcredit in Morogoro and Iringa towns. We used the Ordered Probit to model the relationship between the predictors and the outcome variable. The findings show that the use of child labour plays a more significant role in the profitability of women businesses than any variable included in the analysis. Results have also shown that owners who possess business skills, who have access to markets and those who do not separate business resources from household resources are more likely to experience a profit increase in their enterprises than otherwise. On the other hand, access to loans doesn\u2019t seem to translate into increases in enterprise profit. From these results, we gather that as a poverty alleviation strategy, microcredit access and micro enterprising are not a panacea, but will require other supporting policies and services to enable women to find their way out of poverty.

The growth of private universities was 8 percent annually, or an average of 200 universities per year. The rapid development of private universities results in increasingly competitive competition in acquiring new students. In higher education industries, winning the competition means that the high school graduates choose selected universities to continue their studies. Brand equity is one of the important concept in brand management because strong brand equity will make their brand chosen by its prospective customers. In contrast to general companies which use marketing mix variables as a source of brand equity, universities have a wide variety of targets. So the role of personal communication is very important to validate a university brand. Other forms of personal communications are words of mouth communications (WOM) and communication through the internet media (viral marketing). This research aims to understand the effects of WOM, viral marketing, and brand equity of private universities on decision to choose private universities. Data in the forms of brand equity variables, WOM variables, viral marketing variables, and decision to choose variables are obtained from the questionnaires. The number of samples taken is as many as 750 from high school students in Jakarta and Tangerang. The selected private universities are Mercu Buana University, Trisakti, Bina Nusantara, Gunadarma, Budi Luhur, and Esa Unggul. The data are statistically processed by the method of structural equation modeling (SEM) using SPSS and AMOS. The results of this research indicate that the decision to choose is influenced by brand equity and WOM, while the brand equity is significantly influenced by WOM communications and viral marketing. Viral marketing do not significantly influence the decision to choose, it influence to decision to choose through brand equity. So, private universities should be able to build strong brand equity through positive WOM and viral marketing. The success of managing both WOM and viral marketing can be used as an advantage to win the competition among private universities.

In increasingly turbulent business environments\u2014characterized by complexity, scarce resources, and escalating competitive opportunities and threats\u2014firms are forced to alter intended and realize emergent strategies more frequently than ever before. The eventualities of realized marketing strategies may lead to misalignments between the strategy and the existing administrative system designed to support it. To examine performance implications of such misalignments we use Slater and Olson's (2001) taxonomy of marketing strategies. We distinguish between intended and realized plans and we propose an administrative system framework of structural (i.e., centralization, formalization, and specialization) and dynamic (i.e., interdepartmental connectedness and strategic control mechanisms) parameters for the effective implementation of realized strategies. We propose three-way interactions between realized marketing strategies and the dynamic parameters of the system. Research hypotheses on performance implications and responses from 215 marketing executives show performance differences across strategy types and (mis)alignments of the administrative system. Our findings confirm three-way interactions among strategy types, interdepartmental connectedness, and control mechanisms for all realized strategy types.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.indmarman.2016.11.002", "venue": null, "journal": "Industrial Marketing Management", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2566063630", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["144021213", "167480611", "168149187", "5264164", "153921338", "167482816", "153969606", "153323383", "167625247", "10147501", "9046272", "167305801", "167346712", "154746993", "167490533", "55421323", "153921417", "152953450", "143877327", "167609829", "167432307", "195714588", "13934118", "144344294", "154407962", "166806134", "167739385", "153382029", "154300228", "167842948", "168074558", "146384560", "11389620", "5035071", "167869392", "197869983", "725236", "22516664", "143476569", "56294231", "154241896", "145468697", "59047124", "153371513", "35015927", "197870386", "8464813", "167819237", "26215063", "167943227", "9041130", "198869250", "154067163", "18720267", "9117398", "168001611", "167722593", "17830586", "168043431", "42733100", "154857075", "167791346", "53856696", "154220799", "167934915", "39215613", "55041068", "153898665", "167468311", "167996055", "167775041", "189885733", "5281538", "168028937", "13168820", "146623958", "167592300", "154573556", "2936775", "6763797", "55320078", "167543492", "167846140", "167629311", "167762210", "153340525", "167890701", "145126361", "118263356", "38373858", "143262585", "64883613", "167846037", "12584017", "14271621", "154695278", "167468060", "154472766", "167307523", "144168355", "55773002"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:52104597"}

Many international organizations and bodies, national governments and private sector organizations seek to address this conflict, in particular via transparency, certification and accountability along the material supply chain. This paper analyses the international trade dimension of coltan and gives evidence on the dimension of illicit trade of coltan. The authors start from the hypothesis that illicit trade of coltan sooner or later will enter the market and will be reflected in the statistics. The paper is structured in the following manner: first, a short section gives a profile of coltan production and markets; second, an overview of the mining situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and related actors. The third section addresses mechanisms, actors and measurement issues involved in the international trade of coltan. The final part draws lessons for certification and conflict analysis and offers some guidance for future research. ::: The paper identifies two main possible gateways to trace illegal trade in coltan: the neighbouring countries, especially Rwanda, and the importing countries for downstream production, in particular China. Our estimation is that the value of such illicit trade comes close to $ 27 million annually (2009), roughly one fifth of the world market volume for tantalum production. With regard to any certification the paper concludes that this will become challenging for business and policy: (a) Central Africa currently is the largest supplier of coltan on the world market, many actors profit from the current situation and possess abilities to hide responsibility; (b) China will need to accept more responsibility, a first step would be the acceptance of the OECD guidelines on due diligence; (c) better regional governance in Central Africa comprises of resource taxation, a resource fund and fiscal coordination.

The bail-in tool is used to write down or to convert certain liabilities with the purpose of restoring the capital adequacy. The valuation exercise would determine the amount of loss absorbtion to restore viability of the institution and capital adequacy. The bridge bank tool offers deeper restructuring powers to the competent resolution authority. Sale of the business tool is actually a variation of the bridge bank tool, enabling the resolution authority to transfer assets and liabilities to investors. The asset separation tool always is combined with another tool.

In addition, this study sought to clarify the distinction, not often made in the literature, between a market\u2010 and a marketing\u2010orientation. Data from 73 textiles and garments manufacturers were collected using an instrument based on Narver and Slater\u2019s (1990) scale. Consistent with previous findings in Western cultures, the results of this study are suggestive of a relationship between market orientation and company performance.

It begins with what products to liberalize and how. Clearly, WTO environmental goods negotiations to date show that WTO member countries are divided by this key issue.

The paper also examines how governance influences an alternative metric of not-for-profit performance -- the provision of social insurance. Stronger governance measures are associated with intertemporal smoothing of resources and greater activity in response to negative economic shocks.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2308/ogna-51138", "venue": null, "journal": "National Bureau of Economic Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1854494007,2952642419", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["2263384", "167515577", "153549778", "151148775", "14242605", "155023163", "15305815", "166715863", "2174392", "152995536", "153181473", "36528894", "29701356", "153207420", "54538527"], "inbound_citations": ["35352351", "53118929", "155009710", "55727843", "168808314", "154245483", "2263384", "2263384", "54187043", "156173478", "210706495", "167885422", "11265130", "48908983", "152293135", "17218895", "158655192", "660469", "204796465"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55011018"}

Moreover, this article aims to present a strategy by deal with influence of relationship marketing, brand image, and service quality to decrease customer\u2019s perceived risk and increase customer satisfaction. Hypotheses are tested on questionnaire data on 776 passengers of Iranian airlines in an International Airport. The data was then analyzed by Structural Equation Modeling. The results indicate that service quality, relationship marketing, and brand image are related with customer\u2019s perceived risk. In addition, strong negative correlation has been found between the perceived risk and customer\u2019s satisfaction. The results are limited to airline industry and data collected from one international airport. More examples of researches from other industries and gathering data from larger population will help generalization of suggested model. Managers need improvement of service quality, relationship marketing, and brand image in order to decreasing the customer\u2019s perceived risk and increasing customer\u2019s satisfaction in order to improve the firm\u2019s profitability and performance. This study contributes to the knowledge by empirical study in customer\u2019s perceived risk and customer\u2019s satisfaction relationship. Moreover, proposing an applicable model to reduce perceived risk and increase the customer\u2019s satisfaction will help scholars and practitioners.

However, when there are competing suppliers for any particular component, less is known about such alliances. The intent of this paper is to address some of the theoretical issues that pose challenges in analyzing stable supplier coalitions in such assembly systems. We examine a simple assembly system in which n suppliers sell complementary components to a downstream assembler, who faces a price-sensitive deterministic demand. We assume that k of these suppliers sell commodity components and the remaining n-k suppliers are monopolists. We analyze alliance/coalition formation between suppliers, using a two stage approach that is common in the literature. When not all suppliers are monopolists, predictions on stable supplier alliances is fraught with technical difficulties. We resolve these by showing an asymptotic invariance result. We use this in Stage 1 of the game, to predict the structure of the stable supplier coalitions using a dynamic version of stability that accounts for players' farsightedness.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.1801582", "venue": null, "journal": "Operations Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2282682531", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["12594768", "16962874", "15461062", "153454771", "155027596", "16026639", "42528760", "207567730", "153427950", "207235952", "21631168", "34184557", "167139854", "46712167"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55366478"}

Several behavioural explanations for the return performance of the studied IPOs are explored. In this investigation, the Rock model which relates the level of short run underpricing of IPOs with the information asymmetry between investors seems to work in its precise opposite due to the intense level of speculation over the issues. This behavioural analysis also provides support for the divergence of opinions model since the observed long run underperformance can be associated with the availability of previous information about the firm. Earnings management through discretionary accruals prior to the floatation is also found to be present influencing the performance of the companies where this analysis could be carried out.

This evaluation is based on the inclusion of several studies, which are not yet connected to the health-related issue. The increasing incidence of employee health issues generates high costs for employers as well as for insurers. Workplace Health Management Systems act as preventive measures in reducing health-related costs. Many case studies are used to explain the concepts and the specific cost reduction for the companies analyzed. But there is still a lack of a broad empirical base to provide convincing evidence for the cost-effectiveness of these programs. To demonstrate the general efficiency of these systems, several studies of different concepts with similar characteristics are compared to ensure, that the mandatory implementation leads to positive effects on the economy. We find that by implementing just a few prevention measures, positive returns can be achieved for a majority of sectors. Given that the market seems incapable of creating this allocation improvement by itself, the integration of health management into the Working Conditions Act seems reasonable, since this could allow a Pareto-efficient outcome to be achieved. Consequently, implementation will not lead to a reduction in the competitiveness of European employers, but rather to increased staff retention and improved productivity due to fewer employee sick days and an improvement in public health and makes the mandatory implementation of workplace health management systems a considerable issue for policymakers.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.18267/j.cebr.211", "venue": null, "journal": "Central European Business review", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2942632200", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["4497979", "215103976"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:169894376"}

Research is based on data gained from published by EIB materials and statistics. PPPs are much more complicated in legal, social, political, economical sides than projects conducted traditionally by public sector. Moreover high level of capital intensity of infrastructure assets is a stumbling block to gather the whole amounts to cover investments, mainly in form of loans. Banks become one of the main partners, and at the same time decision makers in PPP projects. A high level of risks in PPP projects combined with high level of capital intensity eliminates small, local banks leaving in the field big commercial banks and multilateral institutions, like as World Bank Group, Asian Development Bank, or in Europe European Bank of Reconstruction and Development and European Investment Bank (EIB). EIB is both a bank and a public institution. Together with loans EIB also offers advisory and technical assistance which can help projects to maximise value for money. As a unique financial institution EIB plays a catalytic role in promoting sound and important projects towards EU policy. The main task of EIB is to contribute towards the integration, balanced development and economic and social cohesion of EU Member States. EIB plays very crucial role in PPP development in EU, specially in countries with not very sophisticated financial markets.

As a result, a full range of professional military services are now immediately available to any sovereign country, NGO or non-state actor with the ability to pay and without the time and cost required to develop organic capabilities. However, unity of command and responsibility for contractor performance is often diluted through subsequent layers of subcontracts and ineffective contract management. As civilian contractors are called to perform mission essential duties on a global battlefield with increasingly fuzzy front lines, rational employment and effective contractual control of the growing military service industry is necessary to manage its increasing influence upon America's National Security. This paper describes the development and growth of the professional military service industry and differentiates the service sector from modern mercenary firms and traditional defense industrial contractors. The scope is limited to military service providers currently employed directly or indirectly by the U.S. Government.

It is determined that one of the main factors of success is the introduction of innovative technologies in the production process, which cannot be carried out without attracting investments. It is the investment activity of enterprises that determines the dynamics of their development, the level of competitiveness and the growth of productive resources, which affects the efficiency of their activities. It is proved that it is relevant to take into account the possible negative effects of the influence of factors divergence. The purpose of the study is to analyse possibilities of determining the impact of life cycle stages on the efficiency of investing in an enterprise. The methodological basis of the research is grounded on the general scientific methods of dialectics, observation, measurement, and formalization; methods of the system and statistical analysis. In particular, to determine the influence of internal factors on the indicators of the efficiency of investment activity of the enterprise at the stages of its life cycle, deterministic factor analysis is applied; methods of systematization and synthesis, analysis and synthesis are also used. It is determined that the construction industry plays a special role in the national economy since its development creates a synergistic effect for the development of other industries, increases the standard of living of the society through solving certain socioeconomic problems. The analytical data of construction enterprises activity in Dnipropetrovsk and Odesa regions of Ukraine became the basis for the approbation of the proposed approach. The use of the life cycle model of the enterprise, which includes the stage of growth (slow and rapid growth, stability stage) and the stage of the fall (slow and rapid fall, crisis stage), is substantiated. The features of investment activity according to the given stages of the life cycle of the enterprise are considered. It is determined that the growth and fall stages have a different effect on the nature of the investment indicators, which depends on certain factors. Further research is aimed at improving the mechanism of monitoring the environment in order to determine the force of factors influence on investment activity and implementation of preventive measures. The lack of a rapid reaction of the company to changes in the environment can lead to a crisis state of management, which determines the high degree of significance of adaptation for any life cycle of the enterprise.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.30525/2256-0742/2017-3-5-183-187", "venue": null, "journal": "Baltic Journal of Economic Studies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2792880227", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["15744511", "156728766"], "inbound_citations": ["197879011", "169517382", "211541721", "181680952", "169673972"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54679015"}

Our simulations suggest that WASH-related mortality will continue to differ markedly across countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In many countries, expected economic growth alone will not be sufficient to eliminate WASH-related mortality or eliminate the economic losses associated with poor access to water and sanitation infrastructure by 2050. In other countries, WASH-related mortality will sharply decline, although the economic losses associated with the time spent collecting water are forecast to persist.

The paper builds a case study on the UK defence industry comprising 22 face-to-face interviews with senior management from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and major first tier suppliers, as well as senior officers in the British armed forces. The results suggest that there are major changes currently taking place that have major impacts on defence supply relationships. The authors find a consensus in the industry concerning a shift towards through-life management (TLM), where major equipment platforms are kept in service for several decades. TLM is widely acknowledged as requiring much closer partnerships in the defence supply chain, in which suppliers assume much greater responsibilities in areas such as in-service support and maintenance. Yet the findings with MoD and suppliers reveal different perceptions of the feasibility and practical implications of the proposed changes. Product-service specific capabilities need to be developed especially in areas such as accurate lifecycle costing. The development of integrated supply partnerships requires greater emphasis on openness, risk and reward sharing, trust and long-term commitment in supplier relationships. There is also a need for early supplier involvement to ensure not only design for manufacture, but design for maintainability and logistics, instigated and managed by the customer (i.e. MoD). The analysis demonstrates the importance of adopting a through-life perspective when considering industrial contexts characterised by very long product lifecycles. This study shows that a through-life perspective creates a blurring of the boundary between customers and suppliers, and increases long-term supplier responsibility. This gives rise to new considerations, such as sophisticated risk and rewards sharing mechanisms, design for maintainability, and technology insertion.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1108/13598540910970108", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2276969115,1983555950", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["53134599", "167544349", "106869023", "167521749", "167609829", "167965404", "55396735", "53704572", "166887125", "54655250", "167500639", "168005981", "56106606", "167847583", "166373276", "166556762", "153293379", "124668450", "167325581", "167417056", "18863385", "145442890", "166240599", "59433166", "153664876", "9771829", "92985069", "207472262"], "inbound_citations": ["55993151", "67771994", "28523780", "55445745", "157301026", "53394891", "55513217"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2815182"}

Three types of public support encountered in various means-tested LTC schemes are examined. First, the level to be considered for means-testing only takes into account the level of wealth of the recipient without considering the cost of LTC or the possible insurance benefits. Second, the public support also considers the LTC needs of the recipient. Third, the means-test structure takes into consideration insurance benefits as well. Our results show that the optimal levels of insurance and informal care as well as their relationship are strongly influenced by the ways means-tested public support for LTC is structured, which have important implications in terms of public policy for the financing of LTC needs.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "28013398", "doi": "10.1007/s10754-016-9206-4", "venue": "International Journal of Health Economics and Management", "journal": "International Journal of Health Economics and Management", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2616359840,2561399917", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["20211609", "12675328", "46685137", "153773855", "154007429", "34230742", "155034095", "13177842", "154895092", "5914869", "211678753", "19266194", "32980969", "154861423", "154648190"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:36656707"}

It is a phenomenon that is increasingly gaining attention because of its negative impacts on human, and natural environments and the economy. Human activities exacerbate climate change and this in turn impacts on livelihood and environment. Urban activities such as transportation and building (household) related activities increase atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. Other activities that contribute to greenhouse gas emission include change of land use, removal of land cover, use of fertilizer, pollution of water bodies, deforestation, industrialization, urbanization and poor municipal waste management. However, it is quite unclear whether urban residents have adequate awareness and understanding of what the phenomenon entails and how their daily activities impact atmospheric greenhouse gases\u2019 concentration. To this end, questionnaires were distributed to 600 households selected from three local government areas in Lagos State. Data gathered were analysed and presented using tables, percentages, pie and multiple bar charts. Result of analysis indicate that although most urban residents indicate various level of awareness of occurrence, they are least aware of the contribution of household activities to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration and that professional property managers hardly sensitize occupants in this direction.

In contrast to previous studies, we explicitly test for the separate effects of individual (retail) and institutional customer responses. The announcement of an accounting charge for junk-bond losses by First Executive Corporation triggers negative stock-price reactions for unrelated life insurers. Insurers with larger portfolio holdings of junk bonds, and greater dependence on retail business, experience stronger negative reactions to the announcement. However, an earlier announcement that regulators were investigating possible junk-bond concealment at FE is positively related to dependence on retail policyholders. The reversal between the two events is consistent with retail customer perceptions responding to disproportionate media coverage, documented by others, of junk-bond problems. Tests of interactions indicate that retail policyholder responses are conditioned on the degree of junk-bond holdings, not indiscriminate. Therefore, our work implies that in the event of a future financial crisis at a large life insurer, realistic, balanced information about the condition of the industry targeted toward individual customers will be useful in preventing a surge in policy surrenders and attendant deadweight losses.", "year": 2001, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.245512", "venue": "Journal of Risk and Insurance", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949103313,1494171944", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics", "Business"], "outbound_citations": ["154320174", "154209527", "155002326", "153717424", "154591857", "154286796", "154424288", "14214187", "154474322", "154075651", "154686576", "153773124", "153558823", "154052832", "152857873", "154511842", "152685275", "153385342", "156355428", "155683243", "154030198", "154097097", "18393956", "154047187", "153056766"], "inbound_citations": ["36640687", "54694483", "154576806", "5969279"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:17375375"}

However, little is known about the taxonomy of both traditional and modern management accounting practices (MAPs) used by SMEs in the process of decision making. In order to address this gap in the literature, this current paper examines the MAPs adopted by the Romanian SMEs. The methodology comprises an analysis of 37 responses to a questionnaire survey carried out among SMEs from one of the most developed regions of Romania. The goal of our study is to determine which tools are being used by Romanian SMEs, and on the other hand, to identify underlying reasons why some specific MAPs are not being used. We find that the large majority of our respondents use a small number of traditional MAPs while most of the modern MAPs documented in the literature and accounting textbooks are very little used. Among the most used traditional MAPs we document the budgeting systems for controlling costs and planning cash flows.

This may be explained not only by the challenges and obstacles in technology development but also by the social relations within the collaborations. The purpose of this study is to explore the role of social exchange in the outcomes of early-stage innovation collaborations. More specifically, we explore the social facilitators of exchange and how such facilitators may influence collaboration outcomes. Social exchange theory is used for this purpose. This longitudinal study is based on a 3-year collaboration project for innovation using qualitative methods (29 interviews, observations of 7 project meetings). Three phases of social exchange in the collaboration are empirically identified: the dating phase, brainstorming phase, and decision phase. Three social facilitators of social exchange within these phases are conceptualized: trust, commitment, and congruence. Further, direct contacts are conceptualized as a social accelerator fueling these social facilitators.

It was a temporary measure to increase the availability of risk coverage for terrorist acts by requiring insurers to provide coverage. Initially established to sunset on December 31, 2005, a two-year extension has been voted by Congress and signed by the President in December. This paper provides an extensive series of empirical analyses of loss sharing under this program in 2005, and a prospective analysis for 2006. Using data collected on the top 451 insurers operating in the United States, we examine the impact of TRIA on loss sharing between the key stakeholders: victims, insurers and their policyholders, and the taxpayers. By simulating the explosion of a 5-ton truck bomb in major cities in the United States, we conclude that taxpayers are likely not to pay anything for losses below $15 billion. For a $25 billion loss, insurers and policyholders would handle between 80 and 100 percent of the loss depending on the property take up rate. Only for terrorist attacks where insured losses were $100 billion would taxpayers have to pay 50 percent of the claims. Recent modifications of TRIA will transfer an even larger part of the risk to the private sector. We also show that if TRIA were made permanent in its current form some very large insurers could strategize by collecting large amount of premiums for terrorism insurance but only would be financially responsible for a small portion of the claims. Commercial policyholders from all insurers (whether or not covered against terrorism) and the federal government would absorb the residual insured losses, raising equity issues. The paper also reviews a set of possible long-term alternatives or complementary options to the current design of TRIA that could be important features of a more permanent program. We conclude that more than four years after 9/11, the question as to who should pay for the economic consequences of a terrorist attack on the US has not yet received the attention it deserves. The new Congress or the White House should consider establishing a national commission on terrorism risk coverage before permanent legislation is enacted.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3386/w12069", "venue": null, "journal": "National Bureau of Economic Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1579908308,1597789980", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["3095106", "154445868"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:108661818"}

Creative destruction is typical in most industry sectors, including luxury, and disruptive innovation by entrepreneurs is key to that process. The paper proposes that the current time is potentially disruptive for incumbent luxury brands and groups, due to five key trends that are beginning to re-frame the markets that luxury brands sell to. On the basis of five years of engagement with the industry, and appreciative inquiry to understand the motivations, approaches and successes of sustainable luxury entrepreneurs, the authors develop a theory of elegant disruption. That is, a well-designed intervention in markets that both uses and affects aspirations in ways that change patterns of consumption, production or exchange, for a positive societal outcome. They profile four sustainable luxury entrepreneurs from USA, UK, Philippines and South Africa, which typify aspects of an elegant disruption approach. In so doing, the paper argues that an assumption that disruptive innovations always start by providing cheaper options does not reflect the way potentially disruptive innovations are occurring in sectors like luxury. In addition, the nature of the disruption need not be immediately about taking market share from incumbents, but by influencing perceptions about the value of incumbent offerings, in ways that generate major risk for the future of those businesses.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.9774/GLEAF.4700.2013.de.00004", "venue": null, "journal": "The Journal of Corporate Citizenship", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2323346692", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["98538120", "154521666", "193336187", "46347949", "141584856", "169726735", "168078871", "166550809", "10498880", "106648274", "166334162", "154845707", "152358274", "181439221", "140965283"], "inbound_citations": ["149590000", "212671053", "208989370", "85538322"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:168060293"}

The mixed method analysis reveals that household composition, gender power dynamics, disability, care responsibilities, marital arrangements, intrahousehold communication, and access to other social programs and institutions play a crucial role in access to the Vision 2020 Umurenge Programme and related asset accumulation. The findings suggest that households would benefit from a broader definition of the eligibility criteria and the availability of flexible and complementary programming, to reap the benefits of the income transfer received from the program.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1596/1813-9450-8759", "venue": "Policy Research Working Papers", "journal": "Policy Research Working Papers", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2917996256", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["26033135", "55846431", "55331744", "154182562", "154542529", "154609339", "17163124", "16973445", "155042372", "52207251", "153916806", "129406705", "197759683", "154957569", "151071936", "201425121", "33748833", "54080561", "918830", "153726627", "73533789", "9287933", "154381095", "154230387", "154621734", "130917631", "153324693", "73581273"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:169650051"}

Using a checklist of questions, data were collected for three farming seasons and simple descriptive techniques were employed in data analysis. The study reveals that acreage among the respondents was very small (2-5 acres mostly) and this has no significant impact on chemical fertilizer utilization. Organic fertilizers used include soil from waste dumpsite, cattle and poultry waste and crop residues. These nonchemical fertilizers are consistently used (>50%) and the costs are cheaper than the chemical fertilizers though with some drawbacks such as not being readily available in required quantity and longer duration of releasing nutrients required by plants. To maximise overall socioeconomic and environmental benefits of organic fertilizers, the recommendations proffered include developing an integrated multidisciplinary soil fertility restoration that will incorporate farmers\u2019 perception into mainstream research; implementing a reward system for farmers and researchers who utilize inorganic fertilizers.

The paper also documents the existence of a feedback-effect of innovation on firms' financial position. Results suggest that the innovative propensity of a company is further affected by the consequences that the choice to innovate has on the likelihood of facing constraints. This in turn is reflected onto a stronger depressive effect of financial constraints on innovation (-34%).

However, customer insight takes many forms, arrives at the organisation from increasingly diverse sources and requires more than mere dissemination if it is to be useful. A multiple case study approach is used to explore managerial practices for insight generation and use. Multiple informants from each of four organisations in diverse sectors were interviewed. Findings reveal the importance of value alignment and value monitoring across the insight demand chain, to complement the information processing emphasis of extant research. Within the firm, the study suggests the importance of customer insight conduct practices including insight format, the role of automation and insight shepherding, to complement the much-researched process perspective.

The government is expanding access to subsidized health for individuals in the informal sector through a rapid expansion of the Green Card program. Generous non-contributory programs, such as the Green Card, may create perverse incentives for individuals to join or remain in the informal sector as they can access free services without paying taxes and/or contributions, thus potentially being able to get higher \u201cnet\u201d labor earnings than in the formal sector. Despite the fact that the Green Card is a large and generous program offered to individuals in the informal sector, empirical analysis in this report does not find an actual impact of the program (or of its rapid expansion) on informality. The reason behind this finding is the existence of a very large differential in wages between formal and informal workers explained by differences worker\u2019s productivity. Low-wage workers facing the possibility to move from the informal sector to the formal sector would have strong incentives to do so even if this would imply losing all SA benefits.

To analyze the smart city policy innovation in Bandung, the researchers used the policy innovation instrument phase from Susanna Borras and Charles Edquist. The method used in this research is a qualitative method with a descriptive analysis method, and data collection was carried out through literature and field study (observation, interview, and documentation). The result of this research is that the smart city policy innovation in Bandung has not been successfully implemented.

However, many scholars have criticised this perception of networked technologies for not being able to meet the needs of city-dwellers, raising privacy issues, and leading to an increase of environmentally harmful consumption of ICTs. The aim of this article is to contribute to the ongoing dialogue by providing a taxonomy of the smart city, based on certain technology governance models.

Apparently there is a need to curb dysfunctional mobility of human capital in the banking sector in the region. A cross-sectional mixed method design was used to collect data. A stratified sample of banking employees completed a semi-structured questionnaire. Key informant interviewing and a focus group discussion were employed to gather supplementary data. Archival data was used in the calculation of turnover rates. The results show a relatively low overall employee turnover rate, and differences in turnover rates for different job levels and gender distributions. The turnover rate for older and young employees is relatively similar. Factors that contribute to job dissatisfaction include better job offers elsewhere, poor compensation, a lack of promotional opportunities, and Black Economic Empowerment initiatives. The findings of the study provide evidence of the most pressing turnover problems that a bank in a less affluent geographic region experiences. The impact of job dissatisfaction on the productivity, efficiency and service delivery in the bank is highlighted and a number of human resource practices are recommended to manage employee and to develop much needed human capital in the banking sector in the region.

In particular, we look at how the alignment between the firm\u2019s governance strategy and the underlying attributes of the transactions affects the capacity of the firm to introduce new products and processes. Using microeconomic data on a repeated cross-section of Italian manufacturing firms for the period 1998-2003, we develop a two-stage approach: first, we estimate the determinants of the firm\u2019s organizational governance (production outsourcing); second, we incorporate a measure of governance misalignment into a technological performance relation. We find (i) that firms not aligned with the optimal organizational governance perform less well in terms of process innovation than more aligned competitors, but (ii) that misalignment has a positive effect on product innovation. However, this counterintuitive result is strongly characterized by non-linear effects that reverse the latter correlation for high values of governance misfit.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.990006", "venue": null, "journal": "The IUP Journal of Managerial Economics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2107617900", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["153660602", "166891763", "155020969", "153759172", "154921842", "54718834", "154875601", "156046963", "18561894", "154549163", "153537133", "154579644", "12035094", "167505092", "167796449", "17769577", "13142968", "17863124", "17338117", "53373898", "153207357", "3721345", "55380122", "7034239", "42419472", "16854836", "67824387", "19766273", "55019081", "154703746", "128975195", "32273446", "13470936", "166789826", "154044356", "195227638"], "inbound_citations": ["7964836", "18062606", "26665509", "46542640", "33314433", "214653395", "54189226", "35820926", "59268093", "167606506", "55098285", "203631827", "43842381", "198588167", "154204644", "73615201", "55975030", "34788436", "2419692", "76652126", "55312011", "2451257", "154884274", "154563350", "22589512", "5326694", "34139297", "96581826", "55226897", "16766659", "1360882", "16977023", "13072227", "2566830", "152389841", "156378643", "152710468", "53345597", "59055447", "52060610", "141058822"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:43692139"}

The answer depends crucially on the fundamental friction that limits private risk sharing in the first place. If risk sharing is incomplete because some insurance markets are missing for model-exogenous reasons (as in Bewley, 1986 and Aiyagari, 1994) publicly provided risk sharing via a tax system generally improves on the allocation of risk. If instead private insurance markets exist but their use is limited by the absence of complete enforcement (as in Kehoe and Levine, 1993 and Kocherlakota, 1996) then the provision of public insurance can crowd out private insurance to such an extent that total consumption insurance is reduced. By reducing income risk the tax system increases the value of being excluded from private insurance markets and hence weakens the enforcement mechanism of these contracts. In this paper we theoretically characterize and numerically compute equilibria in an economy with limited enforcement and a continuum of agents facing realistic income risk and tax systems with various degrees of risk reduction (progressivity). We find that the crowding-out effect of public insurance on private insurance in the limited enforcement model can be quantitatively important, as is the positive insurance effect of taxation in the Bewley model.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jet.2010.08.013", "venue": null, "journal": "National Bureau of Economic Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2115212308,2890952617", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Economics", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["154060519", "153681335", "153342159", "10190133", "151127314", "154352170", "14735384", "16150924", "154776093", "35031032", "153466918", "12771625", "4678422", "152971563", "154862739", "5608449", "6280051", "67789004", "56270831", "154180130", "11729344", "121211590", "154573044", "153778528", "15438374", "53064532", "166365355"], "inbound_citations": ["15355080", "15420869", "56470536", "7097617", "2490221", "15485932", "3759102", "201111942", "18734532", "166352251", "16408427", "210847020", "54670065", "55314020", "56373373", "56459754", "28648900", "15401456", "204428331", "55355356", "158509842", "11388695", "78087589", "209486284", "387811", "150635397", "14802394", "154078890", "26241514", "59476465", "204856615", "55982811", "15656057", "14468282", "155495644", "6332262", "27669365", "16482470", "157206825", "166907246", "7816326"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:8564062"}

In this study, secondary data was collected from CBN bulletins, National Bureau of Statistics and UNCTAD covering periods from 1975 to 2012. The OLS regression method of statistical analysis was employed to analyse the multiple econometric model. The result indicates that total trade, FDI flow, exchange rate and degree of openness are statistically significant to growth. Total trade, FDI flow and exchange rate are positively contributing to growth while degree of openness of the Nigeria economy is negatively contributing to growth. The dummy variable, political stability is not statistically significant to growth in Nigeria. The finding shows that trade contribute positively to economic growth but Nigeria\u2019s trade policies, and implementation is still not growth friendly. As a result of the findings, some policy recommendations were made among which is trade policies in Nigeria need to be reviewed, reappraised and reinvigorated to encourage the gain of trade in order to foster growth, through diversification of the economy to areas such as agriculture, industrialisation, privatisation of the power sector, and building of oil refineries to reduce importation of petroleum produce, among others.

Privacy risks can be reduced when personalization system designs allow for pseudonymous interactions, client-side data stores, and task-based personalization. In addition, interfaces that allow users to control the collection and use of their profile information can further ease privacy concerns.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/1005140.1005158", "venue": "WPES '03", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2172999117,2012915612", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["16891752", "13007784", "60685494", "150591884", "12635605", "2589401", "10693665", "11994439", "1977107", "756250"], "inbound_citations": ["36203336", "42919653", "14129739", "18817051", "8497143", "14261503", "7691627", "1959855", "2479601", "7834419", "14926843", "3011630", "63196340", "18860569", "2936148", "18155338", "5972447", "16022015", "17756238", "12647115", "6128117", "6139691", "9377926", "33380647", "6656496", "35038848", "16386488", "4313938", "16201104", "12081910", "9966701", "14660770", "7613874", "12196045", "15551844", "20465411", "17549850", "18998148", "26261010", "16232690", "6175745", "16297930", "11456449", "2353990", "35907253", "32321593", "8420546", "6256024", "3774478", "52217161", "15675906", "2941898", "17367131", "2722276", "44139968", "166842350", "16714475", "7868342"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:5821780"}

A healthcare logistician (HL) service concept and a healthcare logistician education (HLE) are examples of the latest innovations of the Finnish healthcare logistics. The essential idea behind the concept of healthcare logistician is to free traditional healthcare personnel of the need to conduct logistics operations, enabling them to have more time for patients. Working in the demanding healthcare environment and supporting healthcare professionals in their work requires a new type of combination of logistics and healthcare competences, which can be acquired through a new healthcare logistician education.

Specifically, customers arrive sequentially during a selection phase, and one has to decide whether to accept or reject each customer upon arrival. If a customer is rejected, then a lost-sales cost is incurred. Once the selection decisions are all made, one has to satisfy all the accepted customers with minimum possible production cost. The goal is to minimize the total cost of lost sales and production. A key feature of the model is that customers arrive in an online manner, and the decision maker does not require any information about future arrivals.We provide two novel algorithms for online customer selection problems, which are based on repeatedly solving offline subproblems that ignore previously made decisions. For many important settings, our algorithms achieve small constant competitive ratio guarantees. That is, for any sequence of arriving customers, the cost incurred by the online algorithm is within a fixed constant factor of the cost incurred by the respective optimal solution that has full knowledge upfront on the sequence of arriving customers. Finally, we provide a computational study on the performance of these algorithms when applied to the economic lot sizing and joint replenishment problems with online customer selection.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1287/opre.2015.1472", "venue": "Oper.

The object is to discuss who is responsible for payments of compensation to oil spill victims who are entangled in a political system that lacks legislative and administrative guidelines and framework that will effectively deal with the issue of petroleum compensations arising from sabotage, bunkering and even activities of multinational oil companies.

These unfortunate incidents make the victims individuals and host community, landowners, pond owners and other property owners to demand compensation. It is hereby recommended that the Nigerian government should set up oil pollution compensation funds that will make provision for compensation for oil pollution damage resulting from activities of not only multi-national oil companies but that of oil thieves, saboteurs and pipeline vandals.

The objective of this study was to analyze the PPM practices and methods in two Brazilian technology-based companies, one medium sized and one large. Portfolio management is more complex when a company has a reasonably sized portfolio with multiple projects in the pipeline. The main contribution of this paper is the study of product portfolio management in technology-based companies, which presents and analyzes the main practices that the companies have used for decision making in product portfolios. It was noted that the two companies used financial methods as the main mechanism for product portfolio decision making; not only does this corroborate with international researches on the subject, but it also demonstrates the companies\u2019 concern with the goal of maximizing value.

Notwithstanding the FBOs in Hong Kong may serve as a funding hub for its parent company, FBOs of more complex global banks tend to hold more liquid assets. While our empirical evidence suggests that the complexity of global banks has significant effects on FBOs risk-taking and profitability, the relation depends on how complexity is measured. For example, both the BCBS complexity score and the measure of geographic complexity are significant in explaining FBO profitability, but they have different signs. Likewise, geographic complexity and scope complexity are often found to have significantly different effects on FBOs performance. Taken together, the concept of global bank complexity has multiple dimensions, where different facets could have qualitatively different effects on FBOs in Hong Kong.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.24148/wp2019-22", "venue": "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Working Paper Series", "journal": "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Working Paper Series", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2975661216", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["203259107", "46159918", "154423400", "2289455", "15932880", "166613487"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:204678746"}

This paper elaborates the problems of SMEs with Industry 4.0 that mainly can be related to inherent characteristics like lack of resources. A procedure model is introduced, that mainly consists of 3 steps starting with an analysis of the status quo, where relevant data is gathered. Then KPIs are calculated that should further help to identify focus areas. Finally a decision based on the KPIs has to be made regarding the first steps towards Industry 4.0.

To reduce damage, some countries have implemented species screening to limit the introduction of damaging species. Adoption of new risk assessment (RA) technologies has been slowed, however, by concerns that RA accuracy remains insufficient to produce positive net economic benefits. This concern arises because only a small proportion of all introduced species escape, spread, and cause harm (i.e., become invasive), so a RA will exclude many noninvasive species (which provide a net economic benefit) for every invasive species correctly identified. Here, we develop a simple cost:benefit bioeconomic framework to quantify the net benefits from applying species prescreening. Because invasive species are rarely eradicated, and their damages must therefore be borne for long periods, we have projected the value of RA over a suitable range of policy time horizons (10\u2013500 years). We apply the model to the Australian plant quarantine program and show that this RA program produces positive net economic benefits over the range of reasonable assumptions. Because we use low estimates of the financial damage caused by invasive species and high estimates of the value of species in the ornamental trade, our results underestimate the net benefit of the Australian plant quarantine program.

Brand extension success factors vary according to cultures. Consumers? attitude towards extensions is modified on the basis of their cognitional reactions and relations between the parent brand and extended product and/or product categories. This study aims at conducting an exploratory research and revealing the relationship between the parent brand and the extended brand. More specifically, the impact of parent brand loyalty on the extension is explored. Therefore, the main objective is to evaluate the attitudes of consumers towards brand extensions through brand loyalty. The study analyzes consumers? attitudes towards brand extensions specifically in food and textile industries. This is in particular to portray that consumers respond positively to brand extensions in various industries due to different motivations.During the methodology application process, in-depth interviews were carried out with 16 participants who were selected from employees working for public and private institutions in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. The interviews were conducted in two stages. During the first stage, the interviews lasted approximately 45 minutes and consisted of open-ended questions about participants? brand choices, reasons for choosing the brands they use. The goal was to evaluate their brand loyalty levels. In addition, the participants were provided with the definition of brand extension and their reactions towards extension were noted. In the second stage, the participants were asked to evaluate their attitudes towards brand extensions in food and textile industries along with the factors that have impact on their evaluations. The participants were specifically observed in terms of their approach to brand extensions where the extension was in a totally different sector from the parent brand. The results indicate that brand awareness has a significant impact on brand extensions with regards to quality and trust.

Rather than assuming that the appropriability regime surrounding an innovation is exogenous, we focus on the endogenous choice entrepreneurs face between investing in ensuring control-based appropriability versus investing in the execution and operation of their fledgling businesses. Investment in execution allows entrepreneurs to advance more quickly than competitors, while control requires delays in commercialization. Control and execution are strategic substitutes as they represent alternative paths to earning future rents. Because the size and likelihood of these rents is uncertain, entrepreneurs may be unable to rank these alternative paths in advance, and so their endogenous choice will be grounded in factors such as individual preferences, capabilities, or coherence with their overall entrepreneurial strategy. A subtle consequence is that the appropriability regime ultimately governing an innovation will be the result of the endogenous choices of the entrepreneur rather than more traditional environmental factors. Motivated by notable historical examples such as the invention and commercialization of the telephone, we explore these ideas by considering the choice of appropriability regime among a sample of academic entrepreneurs: within a sample of ventures that could have been developed by either faculty or students (or both), we find that faculty-led ventures are much more closely associated with formal intellectual property, student-led ventures are more rapid in their commercialization activities, and, relative to faculty-led ventures, student-led ventures display a tradeoff between patenting and commercialization speed.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2946078", "venue": null, "journal": "Industrial and Corporate Change", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2932923480,2607730297", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["54768533", "38477860", "166565550", "38456056", "7298121", "155888735", "167917141", "167396526", "153693394", "27371180", "18533255", "86859729", "153396540", "207244206", "18349262", "153547356", "41588664", "9296557", "75736180", "35677597", "153708906", "7856103", "154159452", "155029804", "56344086", "154602415", "15348637", "154596882"], "inbound_citations": ["86859729"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:149448447"}

The system consists of an external supplier, a distribution centre, and a retail level. Each location operates under an (R, Q) reorder point reorder quantity inventory control policy with backordering permitted. The model introduces count-based discrepancies into the inventory records and measures the effect on system performance at the locations and throughout the supply chain. A set of simulation experiments examines two fundamental methods to mitigate the effect of inaccurate inventory records: carrying extra inventory to protect against the errors and using cycle counting procedures to correct the records over time. In addition, the effect of learning through the use of cycle counting procedures and error reduction methods and the effect of non-compliance (not correcting records) within the system are explored. The results indicate that cycle counting can have significant positive effects within the entire supply chain. In addition, the experiments show that the learning effect has benefits both locally and throughout the supply chain. The results also show that non-compliance to the cycle counting procedure by locations within the chain can have significant detrimental effects on supply chain partners and overall supply chain performance.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1504/IJIR.2010.031462", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Inventory Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2062207594", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["18110609", "106574754", "15770792", "154163293", "154999324", "153778840", "108905972", "17845323", "153655020", "166839392", "14690810", "153978252", "15321057"], "inbound_citations": ["28613318", "204791012", "167902295"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15604128"}

However, we find that these effects are concentrated among white (rather than black or Hispanic) drivers. The results are robust to the inclusion of a range of covariates for traffic stops and to the inclusion of local population features interacted with year. The effect on citations holds in a regression-discontinuity specification looking at bare budget shortfalls. These results are consistent with a model where traffic police selectively target higher-income drivers to compensate for budget stress. Also consistent with this view, we find that the racial difference in citation rates is highest where the white-to-black income ratio is highest.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.3192562", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2906127880", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["158379135", "38183163", "144040062", "1547854", "147866539", "158850161", "5858898", "56395223", "20683336", "54850551", "7781545", "152843388", "155566454", "157363699", "159079699", "18367549", "16666495", "157457710", "153257439", "56268406", "15064774", "12585421", "159966696", "156392169", "153902802", "84834049", "145148164", "145782036", "44686122", "147658806"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:188033955"}

The maritime transport sector has undergone numerous changes due to both the economic growth of the emerging countries and the legislative response following the financial crisis (Basel 3).

We conduct what we believe is the first study to explore the extent to which equity is prioritised in the allocation and distribution of aid, based on in-depth interviews with government officials, bilateral and international donors, and implementing partners operating in Northern Uganda. We find that a broad category of people are perceived to be marginalised/vulnerable, with a substantial segment largely untargeted by major donor programmes. Various stakeholders employ a wide range of strategies to identify the most vulnerable individuals and groups, including the use of available data and statistics, consultation and engagement with relevant stakeholders, and undertaking primary data collection. The strategies used to incorporate equity in aid allocation and distribution include: targeting the regions of Northern Uganda and Karamoja in particular, targeting both refugees and host populations in refugee-hosting districts, prioritising the critically vulnerable in any aid distribution process, and using specific tools and consultants to ensure that major equity issues are addressed in proposals.

They exhibit complex nutritional requirements, which is the reason why their production costs are high. Research efforts are being made aimed at evaluating different substrates for their production as well as the production of valuable metabolites from them. The purpose of this paper is to expose the main research and development trends for LAB production for industrial purposes with emphasis on the culture media required for their growth. The web of Science databases as well as the Google Patent Search tool were used in order to gather and analyze the scientific and technical information published in the last twelve years relating to LAB and their culture media. The use of milk, industrial cheese whey, cane molasses, hydrolyzed starches, lignocellulosic materials, organic food waste and bovine blood plasma, among others, have been proposed for Lactobacillus cultivation with the purpose of reducing costs and increasing performance in their production.

We show that the decentralisation of price regulation implies higher expenditure, but higher patients' welfare.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "30044027", "doi": "10.1002/hec.3805", "venue": null, "journal": "Health Economics", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2753817991,2883230768", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics", "Business", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["168026684", "6807473", "29900007", "154346244", "34858398", "153685000", "158600921", "3480639", "10421119", "78293", "24665120", "54827103", "154950851", "4296532", "168709545", "81909078", "154856985", "19741595", "19667499", "36998730", "96476185", "154524204", "46403854", "26777699", "153369947", "30311480", "12033353", "14659483"], "inbound_citations": ["209393692", "76651955", "170041203", "169304199"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:205855460"}

Thus, the government should establish a network of harvester service operators as well as encourage more maintenance training for local operator in order to high utilization efficiency in rice combine harvester.

This study focuses on the main corporate governance attributes of South Africa. The paper concludes with an extensive bibliography. INTRODUCTION Corporate governance issues are especially important in transition economies, since these countries do not have the long-established financial institution infrastructure to deal with corporate governance issues. Before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was no need to discuss corporate governance issues because all enterprises were owned by the state and there were no shareholders. All that has changed since 1989. This study discusses in general how transition economies are dealing with corporate governance issues and the extra obstacles they have to overcome due to a lack of established financial institution infrastructure, then focuses on the main corporate governance issues in a particular country. Corporate governance has become an important topic in transition economies in recent years. Directors, owners and corporate managers have started to realize that there are benefits that can accrue from having a good corporate governance structure.

Escalating sales and selling costs require organisations to be more focused on results and highlight the shifting of resources from marketing to sales. Further the growth in customer power now requires a strategic sales response, and not just a tactical one. The positioning of sales within the organisation, the sales function and sales management are all discussed. ::: ::: The Handbook is not a general sales management text about managing a sales force, but will fill a gap in the existing literature through consolidating the current academic research in the sales area. The Handbook is structured around four key topics. The first section explores the strategic positioning of the sales function within the modern organisation. The second considers sales management and recent developments. The third section examines the sales relationship with the customer and highlights how sales is responding to the modern environment.

Yet trade theory has not considered the implications of institutional differences, beyond treating them simply as different technologies or taxes. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a simple model of international trade in which institutional differences are modelled within the framework of incomplete contracts. We show that doing so reverses many of the conclusions obtained by equating institutions with productivity. Institutional differences as a source of comparative advantage imply, among other things, that the less developed country may not gain from trade and factor prices may actually diverge as a result of trade. Second, we test empirically whether institutions act as a source of trade, using data on U.S. imports disaggregated by country and industry. The empirical results provide evidence of \u201cinstitutional content of trade\u201d: institutional differences are an important determinant of trade flows.

The Japanese monetary authorities, by buying the dollar low and selling it high, have produced large profits, in terms of realized capital gains, unrealized capital gains, and carrying (interest rate differential) profits, from interventions during the ten years. Profits amounted to 9 trillion yen (2% of GDP) in 10 years. Interventions are found to be effective in the second half of the 1990s, when daily yen/dollar exchange rate changes were regressed on various factors including interventions. The US interventions in the 1990s were always accompanied by the Japanese interventions. The joint interventions were found to be 20-50 times more effective than the Japanese unilateral interventions.

This paper examines whether managers strategically use financial policy when facing the risk of one such liability \u2013 litigation claims. I find that greater litigation exposure leads firms to choose higher leverage. I show that this leverage increase is brought on by an active decision to repurchase shares. These repurchases appear to be financed with a combination of excess cash and short term debt as they coincide with a significant decrease in cash holdings and an increase in short term liabilities. These firms also increase their use of operating leases, which, due to their priority in bankruptcy, have similar characteristics to secured debt. Finally, the effects seem to be stronger for firms with a higher probability of bankruptcy. These results run counter to anecdotal suggestions that firms may adjust financial policy to build a war chest in anticipation of litigation and they suggest that firms use capital structure strategically to increase shareholder value.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.1830604", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "200758648", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["199906830", "153519460", "154032379", "169611058", "154044182", "14763078", "154689501", "154653852", "154405919", "151229222", "154328352", "426008", "54831257", "150410291", "153798263"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:33846332"}

Specifically, we propose that social information regarding the beneficial behaviors of others is enhanced under a deliberative mindset. Given the financial insecurity of consumers, as well as the potential for financial services firms to positively affect consumers\u2019 savings decisions, we test this theorizing in the context of savings. Four studies demonstrate that the open-mindedness associated with the deliberative mindset increases the effectiveness of providing high savings social information (i.e., information about the high savings rates of others). This effect does not occur for consumers with chronically high susceptibility to interpersonal influence, who are open-minded to social information regardless of mindset, but is stronger for myopically-focused consumers, who otherwise may be most likely to discount high savings information. Results suggest that financial services firms may improve consumers\u2019 financial well-being by providing high savings social information and eliciting a deliberative mindset in financial brochures, educational programs, and interactions with financial advisors.

We explore two organizational explanations for this variation: differences in firms' IT investment allocations and their IT capabilities. We develop a theoretical model of IT resources, defined as the combination of specific IT assets and organizational IT capabilities. We argue that investments into different IT assets are guided by firms' strategies (e.g., cost leadership or innovation) and deliver value along performance dimensions consistent with their strategic purpose. We hypothesize that firms derive additional value per IT dollar through a mutually reinforcing system of organizational IT capabilities built on complementary practices and competencies. Empirically, we test the impact of IT assets, IT capabilities, and their combination on four dimensions of firm performance: market valuation, profitability, cost, and innovation. Our results---based on data on IT investment allocations and IT capabilities in 147 U.S. firms from 1999 to 2002---demonstrate that IT investment allocations and organizational IT capabilities drive differences in firm performance. Firms' total IT investment is not associated with performance, but investments in specific IT assets explain performance differences along dimensions consistent with their strategic purpose. In addition, a system of organizational IT capabilities strengthens the performance effects of IT assets and broadens their impact beyond their intended purpose. The results help explain variance in returns to IT capital across firms and expand our understanding of alignment between IT and organizations.

We use a sample comprising 79 companies listed on Brussels stock exchange to show that there is a great heterogeneity in current accounting treatment of goodwill. We identify two groups of companies: those that display the goodwill on a separate line in their balance sheet and those that integrate it in their intangible assets. For the later, the only way to notice the presence of goodwill is by looking at the financial statement\u2019s notes presumably because those notes are expected to receive less scrutiny. Even if the compliance is not complete, the first group complies more with the paragraph 134 of IAS 36 than the other. Moreover, companies with a significant goodwill compared to both total assets and intangible assets are more compliant with IAS 36. The findings finally reveal that the notices issued by the Financial Service and Markets Authority (FSMA) have a limited impact on the disclosure level.

The regulatory, technological and economic changes that are now driving the wireless services industry will spawn new technical and business models in wireless service provision, many of which will rely on Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) methods to enable efficient use of spectrum resources. However, the use of DSA methods also requires using policy-based mechanisms in radio devices to facilitate and control the assignment of spectrum given the wide range of communication scenarios in which there may be conflicting goals for the use of this resource (e.g. public safety vs. profit-based services).Spectrum consumption modeling attempts to capture spectral, spatial, and temporal consumption of spectrum of any specific transmitter, receiver, system, or collection of systems. The information contained in the models enable better spectrum management practices and allows for the identification of spectrum reuse opportunities. The characteristics and structure of spectrum consumption models are being standardized within the newly formed IEEE P1900.5.2 group in which the authors participate.Spectrum consumption models (SCM) allow for a fine grained management of spectrum resources in spectrum sharing and market scenarios. This paper presents and discusses our research in establishing a techno-economic framework for the use of SCM to enable spectrum sharing markets. We focus on exchange based spectrum trading markets where the entities wanting to use spectrum resources (spectrum users) make use of SCMs to express the characteristics of their desired spectrum use and based on them a spectrum exchange entity can determine the range of frequencies within the service area that can satisfy a particular requesting entity\u2019s demand and the charge that it should pay. Several trading scenarios and criteria are also explained. We also discuss the use of SCMs and their integration with Policy-based spectrum management in the context of standardization efforts ongoing in IEEE and the WinForum. We hope that the results and insights of this paper are of use to regulators and policy makers and that it provides them an initial exposure to the potential uses of Spectrum Consumption Models and policy-based spectrum management.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2242281", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2117926030", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["14845214", "154524287", "2887685", "15754147", "16062493", "38307379", "206453627", "62778982", "15182025", "167593715", "166955363", "17062686", "13393968", "15230411", "59444106", "62525817", "33123653"], "inbound_citations": ["5833278", "33711954", "6228619"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167715247"}

Like other primary producers, New Zealand strives to increase agricultural output while maintaining environmental integrity. Utilising modelling to explore the economic, environmental and land use impacts of policy is critical to understand the likely effects on the sector. Key deficiencies within existing land use and land cover change models are the lack of heterogeneity in farmers and their behaviour, the role that social networks play in information transfer, and the abstraction of the global and regional economic aspects within local-scale approaches. To resolve these issues we developed the Agent-based Rural Land Use New Zealand model. The model utilises a partial equilibrium economic model and an agent-based decision-making framework to explore how the cumulative effects of individual farmer\u2019s decisions affect farm conversion and the resulting land use at a catchment scale. The model is intended to assist in the development of policy to shape agricultural land use intensification in New Zealand. We illustrate the model, by modelling the impact of a greenhouse gas price on farm-level land use, net revenue, and environmental indicators such as nutrient losses and soil erosion for key enterprises in the Hurunui and Waiau catchments of North Canterbury in New Zealand. Key results from the model show that farm net revenue is estimated to increase over time regardless of the greenhouse gas price. Net greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to decline over time, even under a no GHG price baseline, due to an expansion of forestry on low productivity land. Higher GHG prices provide a greater net reduction of emissions. While social and geographic network effects have minimal impact on net revenue and environmental outputs for the catchment, they do have an effect on the spatial arrangement of land use and in particular the clustering of enterprises.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4440817", "pubmed_id": "25996591", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0127317", "venue": "PloS one", "journal": "PloS one", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1590078017", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8157197", "206110678", "9805771", "128797192", "2985659", "46503565", "128004104", "153368433", "32481715", "130096094", "10048493", "154460146", "58940120", "154657064", "145527456", "15444950", "7229352", "204827434", "3111420", "9668409", "52024590", "37676798", "155060864", "115130695", "130020882", "16243214", "3388882", "59833596", "41227892", "140704959", "153423015", "2027661", "18879535", "142535853", "149974347", "14410096", "85622456", "167935032"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15419816"}

A study has been conducted among UiTM students who stay off-campus to determine the reasons for living in private accommodation. Data was collected from online questionnaires to students of UiTM who live off-campus in the areas of Penang, Tapah, Seremban, Kuala Pilah, Segamat, Samarahan and Kota Kinabalu. Findings shown that in terms of the type of private accommodation, most of the students prefer rented houses more than rented rooms and family houses. Race and distance from the university greatly influence the students to stay offcampus during studies since they can enjoy cheaper rental, free from university rules and regulations and having choices to stay in one house with their friends.

However, the epidemic continues to challenge maternal and paediatric HIV control efforts in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA), with repercussions on other health services beyond those directly addressing HIV and AIDS. This systematised narrative review describes the effects of PMTCT programs on other health care services and the implications for improving health systems in SSA as reported in the existing articles and scientific literature. The following objectives framed our review:To describe the effects of PMTCT on health care services and systems in SSA and assess whether the PMTCT has strengthened or weakened health systems in SSATo describe the integration of PMTCT and its extent within broader programs and health systems. ::: ::: ::: Methods ::: Articles published in English and French over the period 1st January 2007 (the year of publication of WHO/UNICEF guidelines on global scale-up of the PMTCT) to 31 November 2016 on PMTCT programs in SSA were sought through searches of electronic databases (Medline and Google Scholar). Articles describing the impact (positive and negative effects) of PMTCT on other health care services and those describing its integration in health systems in SSA were eligible for inclusion. We assessed 6223 potential papers, reviewed 225, and included 57. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: The majority of selected articles offered arguments for increased health services utilisation, notably of ante-natal care, and some evidence of beneficial synergies between PMTCT programs and other health services especially maternal health care, STI prevention and early childhood immunisation. Positive and negative impact of PMTCT on other health care services and health systems are suggested in thirty-two studies while twenty-five papers recommend more integration and synergies. However, the empirical evidence of impact of PMTCT integration on broader health systems is scarce. Underlying health system challenges such as weak physical and human resource infrastructure and poor working conditions, as well as social and economic barriers to accessing health services, affect both PMTCT and the health services with which PMTCT interacts. ::: ::: ::: Conclusions ::: PMTCT services increase to some extent the availability, accessibility and utilisation of antenatal care and services beyond HIV care. Vertical PMTCT programs work, when well-funded and well-managed, despite poorly functioning health systems. The beneficial synergies between PMTCT and other services are widely suggested, but there is a lack of large-scale evidence of this.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5809942", "pubmed_id": "29450099", "doi": "10.1186/s40985-017-0072-5", "venue": "Public Health Reviews", "journal": "Public Health Reviews", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2772377732", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["8510902", "34158855", "74833403", "677918", "41335896", "26119105", "695213", "25543925", "58810038", "2038743", "16847754", "15218434", "1826994", "3178800", "55256928", "7271404", "16570487", "8805401", "21309772", "7848423", "18229460", "215637832", "42356478", "10746654", "79782152", "23804143", "42883979", "21716427", "207380485", "205639899", "7943711", "43022434", "9455163", "2879699", "40408335", "2134176", "40415776", "1996998", "7989053", "6194756", "33693433", "9599192", "12540019", "3077629", "7506455", "1657142", "2414695", "40533739", "7943711", "2399094", "5776726", "9153464", "205391650", "26353642", "5539895", "13046791", "205998272", "502651", "2985206", "22533856", "23691178", "205392550", "24312345", "3625436", "12719463", "877050", "2077853", "214914547", "30402594", "43718276", "25142227", "215210377", "3000380", "17751205", "73086871", "14341343", "13721923", "205641055", "152124930"], "inbound_citations": ["215278360", "56719528", "204542570", "204857845", "79471034", "86625545", "204965349"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3328113"}

Transnational corporations (TNCs) have substantially contributed to such devastation through their 'double standards' practice. TNCs have been conducting their operations in developing host countries in accordance with much lower environmental standards than those adopted in their home countries or in developed host countries. Considering the seriousness of environmental destruction and the social responsibility of TNCs, it is argued that TNCs should be subject to the same stringent environmental standards in developing host countries as well. Recently, foresighted TNCs have voluntarily adopted uniform stringent environmental standards; however, it seems unlikely that the majority of TNCs will follow suit. The international harmonization of environmental standards also appears unlikely due to irreconcilable national interests. Given the economic dependence on TNCs and the lack of enforcement mechanisms, developing countries do not seem to be able to regulate TNCs effectively. The only remaining possible solution seems to be the extraterritorial application of the environmental rules of the TNCs' home countries.

What motivates Indian firms to repurchase their own shares? Signalling and free cash flow hypotheses are two competitive and popular explanations identified in empirical research in US and other countries. Do Indian firms buy back their shares to correct market misvaluations or to return excess funds? In the present paper an effort is made to decipher the motives behind repurchase decisions of Indian firms. Since there are positive returns only on announcement day and not in post-announcement days the signalling hypothesis cannot be an explanation for positive overall CAR in Indian announcements.

The data used is secondary data sourced from BPS, FAO statistics and IRRI statistics. The research design used in this study is a time series study from 1970-2016. The model used in the study is Least Square (LS). The results of the analysis show partially the availability of national rice influenced by domestic rice production, government rice reserves and rice imports.

However, it is not influenced by the application of appropriate technology (in this case the use of subsidized fertilizer). The conclusion of this study is that the availability of national rice is not only supplied from within the country but must still be supported by the procurement of imported rice. In increasing food independence, productivity must be increased, ensuring that government rice reserves are always available, monitoring the development of rice / rice prices are always stable, and paying attention to the welfare of farmers as the main actors in rice trading.

To this end, we exploit changes in the strictness of transfer pricing regulations and thin capitalization rules over time in a panel of European multinational firms and study a quasi-experimental reform setting in France. We confirm existing evidence that tightening transfer pricing regulations reduces the tax sensitivity of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) substantially. Our results show, however, that this reduction includes both a reduction in profit shifting activity via the transfer pricing channel and a substitution with debt shifting. Moreover, firms using debt shifting to begin with rely more heavily on tax optimization of transfer prices when thin capitalization rules are strengthened. If transfer pricing regulations are also strict, the conditional reform effects show that the substitutive response is more pronounced for a subsample of firms with a high share of intangible property (IP). The difference-in-difference approach for the French tax reform illustrates an increase in profit shifting based on transfer prices for treated firms facing new restrictions on debt shifting. Again, the effect is stronger for IP intensive firms.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.3091567", "venue": null, "journal": "Social Science Research Network", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2783889697", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["166806560", "13904604", "54672623", "151102758", "51415221", "155097381", "27626481", "154776469", "155656417", "153938153", "168243512", "153357648", "34703840"], "inbound_citations": ["169824132", "169350466"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:115135884"}

The impact of employment protection is analysed by means of a regression discontinuity design (RDD) that exploits the variation in EP provisions across firms below and above a size threshold. Using our RDD approach, we show that EP increases worker reallocation, suggesting that EP tends to reduce rather to increase worker security on average. We further show that this can be entirely explained by the fact that firms facing more stringent EP make a greater use of workers on temporary contracts. Our preferred estimates suggest that the discontinuity in EP increases the incidence of temporary work by 2-2.5 percentage points around the threshold. Moreover, further analysis suggests that the effect of employment protection persists among larger firms well beyond the threshold and may account for about 20% of the overall incidence of temporary work. There is also evidence that EP reduces labour productivity and this effect is to an important extent due to the impact of EP on worker reallocation and the incidence of temporary work.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1787/5k40hthb969w-en", "venue": "OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers", "journal": "OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1566997967,2883920007", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Geography"], "outbound_citations": ["150750156", "14275137", "166295391", "154914666", "14533223", "13953638", "5150353", "54990212", "29223399", "6480099", "122895099", "1918137", "18483156", "6049237", "166265287", "14938673", "8275934", "55056453", "2710007", "167189056", "55180613", "152620682", "14393530", "154326686", "56036347"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55046179"}

This paper draws on uniquely rich administrative data on child care centers and their inputs from Sao Paulo to examine the role of local household income in shaping the entry and quality choices of private suppliers. It documents three main facts: (1) entry rates are considerably higher in high-income districts; (2) the quality of provision as measured by teachers\u2019 schooling, group size and equipment is highly heterogeneous across space and increases systematically with local household income; and (3) a considerable share of centers operates below recommended (but not regulated) quality standards, especially in low-income districts.

Not only external but also internal openness positively affect the innovative performance of firm. Among different types of knowledge exchange mechanisms, informal practices are especially effective. On the contrary, joint engagement in formal and informal practices appears to decrease the firm\u2019s share of innovative sales, a possible indication of diseconomies of scale or managerial attention constraints.

In these businesses, existing customers incur significant costs if they switch to another provider. Such costs include physical configuration and installation costs, contractual costs (e.g. termination fees) and cognitive costs of learning. These switching costs enable a firm to extract more revenue from incumbent customers by charging them higher prices. However, higher prices disproportionately deter new customers from buying, because, ex ante, they face similar set-up and learning costs with all providers and hence are more price sensitive. This raises an important question of how best to balance the tradeoff between short-term revenue gains and long-run account growth. We develop an optimal control model to study this tradeoff. We show that a simple target market share policy is the optimal strategy. In particular, there exists a target price and target market share such that the firm should price to reach the target market share as fast as possible, at which point it should switch to the target price. We also examine how these targets change with the competitive outside price, shopping frequency of customers, firm\u2019s discount rate and market growth rate. In addition, we extend the basic monopoly model to the duopoly case in which two firms compete for market share and maximize their expected discounted revenue. We also look at the situation in which a firm is able to charge a lower introductory price to attract new customers.", "year": 2011, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.1923716", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2287306973", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["167513809", "39120960", "6940420", "8443998", "145544845", "154479809", "154796722", "154281180", "153806802"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:30814137"}

The Government is planning to initiate natural gas imports by 2019 to meet the country's energy demands. In order to allocate adequate amounts of natural gas across the geographic regions Indonesia must build more LNG regasification terminals. The Indonesia government has not yet determined if the additional regasification terminals will be floating or land-based facilities. This paper assesses the two options and identifies which facility attains greater profitability. The financial analysis of investing in the Sorong LNG regasification terminal project is conducted using NPV, IRR, and sensitivity analysis. This analysis demonstrates that FSRU facilities have greater economic viability than onshore LNG regasification facilities. The FSRU project earns greater than a 12% IRR as compared to a negative IRR earned by an onshore project. The government can make the onshore projects viable by increasing the sales fee from US$10.00/MMBTU to US$10.60/MMBTU.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1088/1755-1315/150/1/012026", "venue": "IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science", "journal": "IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2804044313", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["153431162", "18281489", "154543156", "166503755"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:169480553"}

NFPA 805 will have been successful in that plants transitioning to it will be as safe as or safer than prior to transition. Plants that made no changes will have at least assessed their fire risks and be more knowledgeable of potential weaknesses that could compromise safety. Having found none, they will not have the need for changes. Plants that made effective changes will be safer than before. If you are one who believes the end justifies the means, then this \u201cbottom line\u201d is all that matters and you need read no further. However, if you are one who believes the means are also important, then you are the audience that I address. I am in no way contending that adoption of NFPA 805 compromised safety \u2013 I, too, believe that plants will be as safe or safer as a result of the transition. Why I wrote this paper is to express frustration over the \u201ccompromises\u201d allowed by the NRC, and the \u201cshort-cuts\u201d and \u201cdeviations\u201d taken by the nuclear industry, to fulfill the promise of a \u201csea change\u201d in fire protection at nuclear power plants through risk-informed, performance-based regulation.

To explore how this tension is resolved we focus on the strategic interaction between researchers and firms bargaining over whether (and how) knowledge will be disclosed.

Statistical verification of the results was conducted using the Pearson chi-square test. ::: Scientific aim: The primary goal of the research project was to examine the situation of brand manager positions offered in the researched labour markets and to provide answers to the questions arising from the research assumption: \u201cEmployers do not publish different requirements for candidates for the job of Brand Manager in Ukraine and the Czech Republic\u201d. ::: Findings: The result of the actual research project in Ukraine confirmed a fundamental need for applicants for brand manager positions with work experience in marketing (51.4%), knowledge of marketing (33.8%), and experience in the field of the advertiser company\u2019s business (31.1%). The application of information technology was found to be the third most important requirement in Ukraine, at 48.6%, unless the requirements for personality traits and skills were taken into account. The assumption regarding the matching requirements for brand manager positions in the two countries was rejected on the basis of the statistical verification process. The statistical test confirmed the shift of requirements even for & = 0.001 in the tested groups of signs. ::: Conclusions: The data gained by studying publicly available recruitment adverts in the selected regions of Ukraine provided information on the most frequently published requirements for the required education and professional competencies based on professional knowledge, skills and type and length of experience.

The author reviewed several empirical studies conducted over several years and found that when consumers were aware of certain country characteristics, they were more inclined to use country-of-origin as an external cue in evaluating product quality and guiding their purchasing decision process. Consumers conferred a higher evaluation of product quality on products produced in developed countries, owing to the technological advances and competitive nature of the markets in these countries. Further, the study revealed that in certain countries, consumers prefer products manufactured locally, owning to ethnocentrism and patriotism. It further identified the challenges faced by multinational corporations as they explore the possibilities of outsourcing the manufacturing of their products to international countries in an effort to reduce cost and maintain price competitiveness.

Primary sources included use of questionnaires, observation and interviews. Secondary sources included desk research, library research on journals, text books and factory publications. The target population was over 700,000 small-scale coffee producers in Kenya out of which the accessible population of 10,000 producers drawn from Githunguri District in Kiambu County was selected which a sample size of 120 respondents was sampled. Stratified sampling technique was employed to compare views among coffee producers from the various coffee societies in the area. Data analysis was both qualitative and quantitative using descriptive statistics. Data presentation was in form of tables to help interpret findings and generate conclusions that aided solutions to identified problems. The research established that marketing factors, finances, government policies and physical and human resources greatly affected coffee production. The study recommended that the government should encourage coffee production by formulating favorable marketing factors and other policies and provide finances to small scale coffee producers. Producers on the other hand should strive to provide conducive working environment to their workers so as to sustain them in their farms.

There are several main problems of Serbian tourism. Biggest one is the lack of traffic infrastructure. Also, Serbia is not very well recognized as attractive tourist destination. Tourist facilities are insufficiently developed. Also, the structure of employees working in the field of tourism industry in Serbia is problematic. The fact that tourists stay in Serbia between three and five days, means that tourists are not very well informed about the possibilities that Serbian tourism offers.

However, the potential value of fisheries in WPP-RI 711 has been decreasing starting from 2016 to 2017. The problems are about fisheries resource management activities in the region which are then linked to government policy control. This study seeks to determine the development of fisheries resource production in FMR-RI 711, the level of utilization based on management with the MSY and MEY models, and also control of sustainable fisheries policies. This study uses experimental quantitative methods with the Schaefer, Fox and Gordon models. Data obtained came from fisheries resource groups and data samples were taken from shrimp groups. The results of the analysis show that the average development of fisheries resource production in FMR-RI 711 has decreased even experienced overfishing in the commodity of Small Pelagic Fish and Crustaceans. The Schaefer model is considered the most appropriate because it has a determination coefficient value of 42.9% and has an optimum effort value of 179 trips/year, with the MSY value obtained at 3.8520 tons/year. The policy controls carried out so far are still very lacking and need to take firm action from the government in overcoming fisheries problems that are overfishing. Therefore, it can be concluded that fisheries management in FMR-RI 711 has not run optimally, then fisheries management should also be carried out by considering the economic aspects of fisheries, besides it also needs serious efforts on fisheries supervision and the development of a cost model to maintain resources from overfishing.

We exploit a unique multicountry setting where firms are required to comply with the same set of international reporting standards. We develop an approach of cross-country comparisons allowing for differences between firms within a country and we investigate the relative importance of country- versus firm-specific factors in explaining accounting quality. We find that financial reporting quality increases in the presence of strong monitoring mechanisms by means of ownership concentration, analyst scrutiny, effective auditing, external financing needs, and leverage. Instability of business operations, existence of losses, and lack of transparent disclosure negatively affect the quality of accounting information. At the country level, we observe better accounting quality for firms from regulatory environments with stronger institutions, higher levels of economic development, greater business sophistication, and more globalized markets. More importantly, we find that firm-specific incentives play a greater role in explaining accounting quality than countrywide factors. This evidence suggests that institutional factors shape the firm's specific incentives that influence reporting quality.

Despite this commitment, significant gaps exist in the national HIV/AIDS monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. To identify these gaps and opportunities for improvement, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded the Strengthening HIV Strategic Information in Kenya project, which conducted an organizational HIV M&E capacity rapid needs assessment (RNA). METHODS: The project included an in-depth desk review of national documents, policies, tools, and international best practices. National, regional, and district officials from government agencies, development partners, and implementing partners participated in key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Given the large number of regions and districts, purposive sampling was used to select 16 facilities in 8 districts across 2 regions based on the general quality of the reported HIV data and the number of partners supporting the regions. RESULTS: RNA findings revealed tremendous improvements at the national level and in the various subsystems that contribute to the overall HIV strategic information. There also were significant gaps, including in a lack of M&E guidelines, parallel reporting systems, feedback given to subnational levels, and data use and general data management and use capacity at subnational levels. CONCLUSION: An urgent need exists for the development of national M&E guidelines and a comprehensive training curriculum. To ensure success further, capacity building for subnational levels should be conducted and feedback channels to subnational staff should be established and maintained.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC3670202", "pubmed_id": "23734274", "doi": "10.11604/pamj.2013.14.129.2581", "venue": "The Pan African Medical Journal", "journal": "The Pan African Medical Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1965249780", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["17101793", "214851579", "38618735"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18911985"}

The descriptive analysis shows that foreign technological activity more than doubled during the observation period with persistent spatial heterogeneity in Germany. Using a pooled count data model, we estimate the effect of various sources for externalities on the extent of foreign technological activity across regions. Our results show that foreign technological activity is attracted by technologically specialised sectors of regions. In contrast to existing findings this effect applies both to foreign as well as domestic sources of specialisation. We show that the relation between specialization and foreign technological activity is non-linear and that it is influenced by sectoral heterogeneity.

Our study is not simply a matter of dealing generically with the financial solvency of conventional and Islamic banks. We also analysed the inherent implications that may alter the results of an operative evaluation of banks. Two samples were taken from two reference groups of population in the selected countries. The choice of banks is limited to countries whose banking systems incorporate both Islamic and conventional banks.? Each list bank was subsequently reduced on the basis of qualitative and quantitative filtering criteria. Therefore each conventional bank has an Islamic equivalent. This restriction reduced the sample size to 63 banks each. The selected banks are all large and listed on various stock exchanges.

The Banyan Tree Bangkok and the Chumphon Cabana Resort were included in a case study. The research examines the important reasons underlying the success of local hotels, while the research also reveals that CSR achievement is strongly related to the international level of firms. Archive document analysis, eight in-depth interviews, and site observations were employed to obtain the data needed from both hotels. Content analysis was conducted to evaluate the collected data, leading to the summarizing of the differences and similarities between the hotels. A new CSR management conceptual model was constructed taking into account the different contexts of the two hotels. The paper reveals two new models for achieving CSR: Outside-In and Inside-Out according to Deming Cycle: Plan, Do, Check, and Action. The Outside-In concept is based on reaching the standard of CSR with the aim of getting a certificate, while the Inside-Out concept is based on the economic sufficiency philosophy aimed at sustainability. For future research it is recommended that the opportunity be taken to generalize the CSR best practice to other hotels, as well as to employ quantitative methods to examine CSR.

This suggests that the differences lead to better understanding of cultural influences on e-marketing and provide practical implications to internet companies offering services internationally.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1504/IJMCS.2016.076657", "venue": "International Journal of Multinational Corporation Strategy", "journal": "International Journal of Multinational Corporation Strategy", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2402250909", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["51304337", "120179321", "109803381", "168114871", "204305865", "18851494", "167871355", "3138489", "35587230", "7026565", "167614323", "51681784", "140489522", "16358599", "167690944", "154977983", "155891708", "145428141", "5774443", "167528485", "167702848", "167570905", "155044787", "22285473", "15463784", "9627597", "16162723", "167491845", "144283466", "167361187", "167991534", "167730712", "166741774", "166527506", "167883782", "17444133", "645528", "168109750", "900840", "167370343", "17797514", "121267275", "168015951", "166937663", "153044676"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:168282654"}

This presentation will explain how the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries Technical Services implemented changes in workflow for ordering and cataloging e\u2010books. Including the topics of technology, user expectations, and getting reference librarians on board, we\u2019ll cover the why of e\u2010books, what has gone well, and where we go from here. Carnegie Mellon University is a global research university of approximately 13,200 students, representing 114 countries. Over 5,000 faculty and staff representing 48 countries work and teach at the main Pittsburgh campus, Silicon Valley campus, and Qatar campus. The University Libraries in Pittsburgh are made up of three separate libraries. The Hunt library houses fine arts, humanities, and social sciences collections. It has recently become the home of the Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology Network (IDeATe). The Sorrells library holds the engineering, materials science, computer science, and robotics collections. The Mellon Institute contains biology, chemistry, and other life sciences collections. Users of these libraries need access to e\u2010Books, and we\u2019re here to tell you how we do that. Let\u2019s hop into Mr. Peabody\u2019s Way Back Machine for a moment. In 1999, Carnegie Mellon University Libraries purchased its first e\u2010book collection through PALINET (now Lyrasis). It consisted of a collection of computer science titles which immediately became very popular. I thought, \u201cWow, this is the future and we should buy more e\u2010books.\u201d Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t that simple. It took some persuasion to get the publishers and librarians on board with the idea of offering users e\u2010books, and we\u2019re still working with publishers and librarians on this front. I\u2019ve found our STEM librarians to be very amenable to the e\u2010book format. Most of their journals and proceedings are electronic, and they realized electronic access for users made more sense. I need to add that one of the big drivers for purchasing e\u2010books is space. Both the Hunt Library and the Sorrells Engineering and Science Library have space issues. We needed more space for student study areas. At this time, e\u2010books were, for the most part, only available through the publishers who required license agreements for their titles. License agreements with publishers are included in my routine. Our workflow for license agreements runs through the University Contracts Office. I do not sign license agreements, and the lawyers I work with understand the language much better than I do. When the publishers send me a contract, I read it over for items that are problematic. Ownership, usage rights, interlibrary loans, and library access (are all campuses included?). Then I send it over to University Contracts, who lets me know if there are issues they have questions about and then sign off on the license. I then forward an electronic copy of the signed license agreement to the publisher and in turn the publisher sends me a fully executed copy of the license. This is a pretty streamlined process. In 2006, we signed licenses with ebrary and e\u2010 book Library (EBL), two aggregators of e\u2010books. In addition we were still gathering licenses from publishers who weren\u2019t part of an aggregator\u2019s list. When acquisitions staff began ordering e\u2010books, the lines between acquisitions and cataloging began to blur. Acquisitions staff download the MARC records either from OCLC or the vendor/publisher website, and use MARC Edit to Copyright of this contribution remains in the name of the author(s). http://dx.doi.org/10.5703/1288284316268 275 Charleston Conference Proceedings 2015 add local information and load the records into our ILS. Once YBP began offering e\u2010books in the GOBI database we started ordering from them. This made sense to us because YBP is our primary book supplier. This change also meant we needed to sign a new license agreement with most publishers, reflecting the use of GOBI to order e\u2010 books. A portion of our approval plan with YBP, the Sciences, has become e\u2010preferred. Then something new was added to the confusion of e\u2010books: different platforms. The decision to select the platform is made by the librarians requesting the title. It\u2019s not just the platform, but the number of users is also important. They know their users\u2019 needs. E\u2010book reader technology continues to change, and we do our best to stay on top of the latest technology so our users can download and read texts on a variety of devices. Our users\u2019 expectations are to be able to access e\u2010books on any device they may be using, from smart phones to tablets to whatever comes next. Finally, usage statistics no longer come from reports from our ILS but from aggregators/publishers websites. These statistics become more important as annual circulation figures drop from our print collection, which is a story for another day. And now, I\u2019d like to introduce Terry Hurlbert, the cataloging senior librarian who will tell you her side of the story. I\u2019d like to make it clear from the outset that I\u2019ll be talking about \u201cpurchased\u201d collections, not titles acquired via DDA. And my main focus is the workflow for loading e\u2010book MARC records into our catalog (Sirsi/Dynix). From the cataloging side of things, here\u2019s a little history: E\u2010books were first on our cataloging \u201cradar\u201d in 2004 as we began to acquire a substantial number of individual e\u2010book titles. Initial titles were requests from selectors that came via the acquisitions process or free titles for Figure 1.

Turkey, as being a developing country, is trying to integrate to the global economy by amending new regulations such as Turkish Trade Code 2011 or by adopting recently developed guidelines such as IFRS. As a result of the adaptation efforts to the world economy and changing regulations there might be dissension or consensus on emerging issues such as the adoption and mandatory use of IFRS. Major aim of this study is to reveal the personal evaluations of accounting professionals and accounting academicians, whom might be considered as implementation and conception parties respectively regarding to accounting and IFRS. A short questionnaire is directed to 66 accounting professionals and 36 academicians in Konya/Turkey in order to determine the general tendency of professionals and academicians towards IFRS. Results are processed by means of SPPS software and findings are compared quantitatively. This study is designed to shed light on the situation rather than seeking a remedy for a specific problem.

The desertion of traditional housing estates and the poor sales performance of new residential projects has put a dampener into the national property market. Thus, this study was conducted in two stages at the southern region of Malaysia. First, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 residents in crime-prone localities using snowball sampling.

To operate nuclear facilities in local communities, local governments would conclude safety agreements with power companies. In recent years, local governments have used the safety agreements as excuse for delaying the operations of nuclear facilities. The legal basis of the safety agreements was questioned by some who considered that this was the cause of the stranded relationship between local governments and power companies, and in some cases, the interrupted nature of electricity supply. To understand the sources of this difficult relationship, safety agreements must be analyzed, although these documents may have undergone revisions, and various regulations may have changed. By analyzing the safety agreements and revisions, we found that the relationship between local governments and power companies gradually changed over time, which can be divided into the following 3 stages: (1) in the early 70s, the dawn stage when local governments groped with the situation of nuclear facilities built in their communities; (2) from late 70s to 90s, the stage when local governments demanded information, and (3) from late 90s to present, the stage when local governments demand information and trustworthiness. This paper shows the results of analyzing the relationship changes between local governments and power companies. We conclude that viewpoints of local governments on nuclear power evolve, as social responsibilities of power companies stipulated in safety agreements also evolve over time.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3327/taesj.J07.048", "venue": null, "journal": "Atomic Energy Society of Japan", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2326336890", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:168133674"}

On the one hand, concentration of ownership that, in turn, concentrates management control in the hands of a strategic investor, eliminates agency problems associated with dispersed ownership. On the other hand, it may lead to entrenchment of upper management which may be inconsistent with the objective of profit (or value) maximisation. This paper examines the impact of M&A on profitability of firms in India, where the corporate landscape is dominated by family-owned and group-affiliated businesses, such that alignment of management and ownership coexists with management entrenchment, and draws conclusions about the impact of concentrated ownership and entrenchment of ownermanagers on firm performance. Our results indicate that, during the 1995-2002 period, M&A in India led to deterioration in firm performance. We also find that neither the investors in the equity market nor the debt holders can be relied upon to discipline errant (and entrenched) management. In other words, on balance, negative effects of entrenchment of ownermanagers trumps the positive effects of reduction in owner-vs.-manager agency problems. Our findings are consistent with bulk of the existing literature on family-owned and group affiliated firms in India.", "year": 2008, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.970001", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1661415457", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["154117915", "154276047", "154971096", "154616008", "55359181", "154991013", "155043365", "153029108", "13177687", "151056930", "13930096", "154067837", "154977513", "153432722", "153401426", "154035711", "167457882", "59376685", "167579336", "153865127", "154110939", "53342209", "154781811", "53414792", "153988031", "167413351", "168118559", "157357755", "41420870", "41150860", "153711193", "154606492", "153538983", "152819107", "154132340", "29359424", "153714719", "53399844", "7083620", "154152715", "154274907", "154320190", "38410339", "154394089", "53600231", "31496474", "167545019", "154231932"], "inbound_citations": ["202605055", "36245393", "59329249", "168117970", "6262289"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55228573"}

Data management includes the processes of data collection and storage thereof, as well as analysis and interpretation of data to guide the future planning, implementation and evaluation of EHDI programmes. There have been limited studies on data management in the South African EHDI context. Methods: The aim of this study was to determine the type of data management systems in use in South Africa and whether they allow for cross-disciplinary sharing and evaluation of the EHDI processes. A survey instrument on the management of EHDI data was developed and sent to HI HOPES referral agents in both public and private sectors. Results: A return rate of 80% was achieved, with 19 (59%) public sector and 13 (41%) private sector audiologists participating in the study. The data revealed that there was no uniform data management system in use nationally, and no consistent shared system within the public or private sectors. The majority of respondents (44%) used a paper-based system for data recording. No institutions were using data management systems that enabled sharing of information with other medical professionals. Conclusion: Data management and tracking of the pathway from screening to diagnosis to intervention is necessary to ensure quality care and outcomes for children identified with hearing loss. International studies reveal the importance of effective implementation of data management systems; however, to date these have focussed on developed country contexts.

The paper at the product level finds that aircraft parts and automobile parts and the components industry are emerging areas of production fragmentation in manufactured goods trade over this sample period. It further observes that aircraft parts (SITC 79295) is the only parts and component product to undergo product fragmentation at the higher end of the global value chain and that the auto parts and components industry is found to be experiencing this primarily at the lower end of the value chain.

To cope with the rising public importance of sustainability is a big challenge for all animal farmers and more industrialized operations especially. Confined animal farming operations (CAFO) are seen very critical by many consumers with regard to their sustainability performance, however, the need to improve the sustainability performance especially in the ecological and social dimension exists at both ends of the intensity, i.e., also for the small holder and family owned animal farming models. As in livestock operations, feed and manure contribute the majority to the three most critical environmental impact categories global warming potential (GWP), acidification (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP) any effort for improvement should start there. Intelligent combination of nutrient-, emission- and waste management in an integrated low emission farm (LEF) concept not only significantly reduces the environmental footprint in the ecological dimension of sustainability, but by producing renewable energy (heat, electricity, biomethane) with animal manure as major feedstock in an anaerobic digester also the economic dimension can be improved. Model calculations using new software show the ecological improvement potential of low protein diets using more supplemented amino acids for the Chinese pig production. The ecological impact of producing biogas or upgraded biomethane, of further treatment of the digestate and producing defined fertilizers is discussed. Finally, the LEF concept allows the integration of an insect protein plant module which offers additional ecological and economical sustainability improvement potential in the future. Active stakeholder communication about implementation steps of LEF examples improves also the social aspect of sustainability.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC5945937", "pubmed_id": "29767170", "doi": "10.1016/j.aninu.2015.08.001", "venue": "Animal nutrition", "journal": "Animal nutrition", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1123919166", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["1158786", "84902176", "167744316", "84810753", "19491871", "83731586", "7725694", "109059725", "85430925", "129544099", "29218593", "82850308", "39005374", "83497448", "28944902", "26909733", "84564604", "154437005", "36739614", "113686380", "84513272", "6595993", "2256000", "86744401", "126543888", "55413871", "85419797", "128452024", "46881380", "85123904", "40896732", "981138"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:21705113"}

Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts from across the value chain including product designers, manufacturers, users and waste managers as well policy makers and academics.

Three inter-connected factors that limit opportunities and instances of reuse of electrical and electronic equipment were identified, highlighting that both systemic and consumer barriers to increasing levels of reuse exist. These are: producer reluctance, unsuitable collection infrastructure and cultural issues. Overall, the paper shows that low levels of reuse in the electrical and electronic sector are a result of complex and interlinked barriers. Understanding these connections offers the potential to improve the opportunities for reuse, by providing direction for policy makers to address barriers from a multi stakeholder perspective. Increasing instances of reuse is essential if the UK is to successfully move towards a resource efficient, circular economy.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.rcrx.2019.100004", "venue": "Resources, Conservation & Recycling: X", "journal": "Resources, Conservation & Recycling: X", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2949842344", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["154995731", "16620599", "153549262", "22914113", "131763858", "22932444", "10594250", "51680506", "113474732", "111276693", "10330888", "55085892", "104382407", "19607910", "110830434", "110828377", "108584825", "27289666", "5298388", "157025359", "169215436", "55140334", "110111895", "145448276", "53533469", "167562046", "115598265", "143804919", "145361381", "41203120", "20204369", "110062796", "8775326", "14229053", "6828801", "153639870", "153296100", "113901785", "109088496", "153704067", "158062996", "116459600", "153395727", "109610167", "31572856", "31572856", "205671836", "205674380", "16064662", "206540129", "110049170", "37448103", "113449132", "29048101", "157353659", "14094281", "14495052", "142633086", "159096613", "155816944", "155042554", "4469536", "94406224", "110565894", "154634404", "116808367", "159002463", "7703014", "15747887", "116028556", "46139944"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197893023"}

Existing research has mostly relied on the localised knowledge spillover, or LKS, model to explain this. This model holds that knowledge transfer across distance is costly, and collaborating locally reduces the risk of information loss when the knowledge is transferred. However, there are various other reasons that could also explain the pattern. If the local university can make a useful contribution, firms might choose to look no further. Firms may also see collaboration as a long-term investment, helping to build up research quality at the local university with the hope of benefiting in the future. Finally, firms may want to contribute to the local community. We extend the LKS model with these additional motivations and explore their validity using data from 23 semi-structured interviews of firms that collaborate intensively with lower-tier local universities.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1080/00343404.2017.1413237", "venue": null, "journal": "Regional Studies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2782095641,2787708015", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["2728245", "155854773", "18755872", "154482351", "155684855", "158558066", "154355592", "9246547", "2802918", "11129025", "15118911", "155142175", "167866896", "154101264", "154647154", "86842400", "55878172", "144559378", "154464279", "109763601", "18864843", "188331234", "153873515", "124430577", "154005201"], "inbound_citations": ["204855729", "214637831"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:113400524"}

{"paper_id": "168687968", "title": "Improving the customer experience", "authors": [{"first": "C.", "middle": [], "last": "Runge", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "This project was executed for ING Bank, division Retail Banking Benelux, Sub-division \u2018Mortgages and Leads\u2019. Based on consequences resulting from the financial crisis there are several new regulations that will be implemented in 2013. One of these regulations is the Provision ban on mortgage advice. This change will affect customers in their decision process when looking for mortgages. Therefore the objective of this project was to put the customer first and ease his and her mortgage orientation process in order to improve the customer\u2019s quality perception of ING. To achieve this the focus was put on identifying how online review and rating sites currently influence customer quality perception and how these online sites can be designed in the future as new interactive service tools that in turn influence, build brand trust and recognition and put the customer quality experience first. The guiding question was: how can online review sites be used as service tools to help improve the customer journey and experience which in turn will improve the customer quality perception of ING\u2019s mortgage advice. This question was addressed through an extensive literature review into extant articles that cover service touchpoints, customer decision journey and online review sites. Next to that a customer research shed light onto which points of the customer journey are of high impact to the decision process. The results from these inform the research question. The main findings showed that service touchpoints and support throughout the decision process have a crucial effect on the customer experience process of acquiring a mortgage. The customer will come in contact with physical and online service touchpoints that let customers infer a quality perception of the service provided and the service provider. These touchpoints should help guide a customer\u2019s decision process through alleviating uncertainty. It was found that this was not the case with touchpoints throughout the mortgage acquisition process. Review and rating sites were found to be useful in guiding difficult decision points and help customers orient and evaluate. The best practice guidelines for such review sites advice to separate reviews into two categories that address the \u2018financial mortgage product\u2019 and the \u2018mortgage service\u2019 provided in form of call, mortgage advise, branches and websites. Customer research especially showed that there are eight main factors that influence customer decision making and perception: trustworthiness-, expertise-, independence-, intentions-, and transparency of the service provider as well as the advising party, support in the decision making process and ease of process, and finally expectations \u2013 customers want their needs to be understood and taken to heart. The objective was reached through deducing findings from literature review and customer research into strategic recommendations. The overall strategic recommendation for ING is to develop a review website with emphasis on providing the customer with expert knowledge and advice. This recommendation entails two pivotal steps. First creating an all bank review and expert site that responds to the immediate customer need of overview on financial mortgage products and mortgage services once the commission ban is implemented in 2013. Second, before step one can be implemented ING should also focus on developing a review and expert service on the ING.nl site with focus on improving the customer journey and making it more accessible through direct online customer interaction with mortgage experts and customer reviews. This service in the future can be developed to include track-and-trace mortgage process possibilities and direct online video call communication with mortgage advisors. The vision here is that the ING.nl site will develop towards providing online service for customers and guiding them through their service journey with support and guidance of mortgage expert advice.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31705108", "doi": "10.1038/s41415-019-0894-2", "venue": "British Dental Journal", "journal": "British Dental Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2587973540", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:168687968"}

The method used in this research is a qualitative descriptive method using multiplier effect analysis and business feasibility analysis. The results of the study show that seaweed, capture fisheries, freshwater farming, salt, artemia, and tourism have the potential as economic prime-mover of small-scale fishery in East Sumba.

In Study 1, based on a sample of 194 self-employed and 1511 employed individuals, we find that self-employment is marginally related to allostatic load and allostatic load marginally mediates the relationship between self-employment and physical, but not mental, health. Study 2, based on a sample of 776 self-employed and 8003 employed individuals, extends these findings, and provides evidence that those who are self-employed for longer periods have a higher allostatic load. Finally, in Study 3 we draw on a sample of 174 twins and, consistent with Study 2, show that those reporting self-employment in two waves (about eight years apart) had a higher allostatic load, however, when leveraging problem-focused coping such individuals experienced lower allostatic load.

The motivation for outsourcing is to focus on core business and improve efficiency and outsourcing companies usually outsource a number of functions and the efficiency gains depend on the ability for the suppliers to deliver the required quality at the right time. If only one is late or delivers a substandard product, it will delay the entire process or reduce the quality of the final product. The timeliness of delivery and the fulfilment of quality standards depend critically on the availability of producer services. Transport, communication and other logistics services are obvious in this respect, but also services such as testing and technical services contribute to enable suppliers in low-cost countries to enter the outsourcing market. I therefore argue that international outsourcing can best be understood within an analysis framework of many suppliers that are interdependent, and the O-ring theory of production is such a theory. The paper first presents and modifies this model and then explores its predictions in an empirical analysis of the determinants of international vertical specialization as defined by an index developed by Hummels et al. (2001). The index is calculated for a cross-section of 52 countries and 5 sectors and regressed on a number of variables affecting the timeliness of delivery. It is found that vertical specialization is sensitive to trade barriers and infrastructure quality and cost of infrastructural services. The relative importance of trade barriers and various indicators of infrastructure vary between sectors. Vertical specialization in the electronics sector appears to be most sensitive to trade barriers and the density of the telecommunication network. This is also the case for the motor vehicles sector, but the size of the parameters is somewhat lower. The chemicals sector is most sensitive to the restriction on maritime services, while for textiles and clothing the aggregated measure of infrastructure had the highest explanatory power. Only in the electronics sector did the wage level (GDP per capita was used as a proxy) matter for vertical specialization.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.929969", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1553501094", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["7277314", "2985645", "14024449", "201468576", "154864675", "44270415", "10980310", "6751817", "15747494", "167148308", "2562917"], "inbound_citations": ["67796790", "17239618", "56103658", "56103658", "198761162", "15078682"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:6707485"}

At low levels of managerial ownership, agency costs of equity (such as perquisite consumption) reduce the returns earned by acquirers. As the managerial stake in the acquiring firm increases, the interests of managers are more closely aligned with those of shareholders, reducing the acquisition premium. At sufficiently high levels of managerial ownership, managers value a reduction in the risk of their nondiversified financial portfolio. However, managers enjoy nonassignable private benefits of control at high levels of ownership which they are not willing to lose by selling their stake in the financial markets. These benefits of control are increasing in the managerial ownership stake and can lead to managers 'overpaying' even when they own a substantial fraction of the firm. Examining mergers that occurred during 1985 to 1991, we find evidence of such a nonmonotonic relationship between the stock returns earned by acquirers and their managerial ownership level.

Beginning in the 1990s the country focused on re-designing its health system in an attempt to rationalize resources. In order to improve the efficiency, access and quality of health care service provision, the Government undertook supply-side reforms. These reforms included: (a) strengthening Primary Health Care (PHC) provision; (b) downsizing excess hospital capacity; and, (c) changing provider payment mechanisms and introducing a purchaser-provider split.Armenia introduced the Basic Benefit Package (BBP) in 1999 for the socially vulnerable population to target the so-called socially important diseases. The package utilizes public resources to finance, through provider contracts, PHC and emergency services for all Armenian citizens, with co-payment exemptions for the poor and vulnerable. In addition, selected inpatient services are provided for free for the poor, vulnerable and other specific categories.Unfortunately, low public health spending levels and incomplete demand-side health financing reform have resulted in serious shortcomings in financial risk protection outcomes. Armenia\u2019s public health financing is among the lowest in the region. High co-payments for BBP covered services, lack of in-patient care coverage for the non-vulnerable population and outpatient pharmaceuticals for all, have resulted in household out-of-pocket (OOP) spending being the predominant source of financing for health in the country. As Armenia is grappling with an aging society and a health care system struggling to adjust to morbidity and mortality epidemiological changes, its path to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) requires increased funding from prepaid pooled sources in order to sustain and make further progress on improving population health outcomes and financial risk protection.This paper examines the Armenian health system, with a focus on the BBP program. It takes stock of implemented reforms and analyzes the pending agenda. The paper is organized as follows. Section two provides a general overview of Armenia\u2019s health system, focusing on financing and health service delivery. Section three describes the BBP program including its institutional architecture, beneficiary targeting, BBP services and fund management, and related information dissemination. Section four discusses the sustainability of the BBP program amidst economic, epidemiologic, and demographic challenges.

On the basis of research materials of such scientists as Baranovsky O., Bovsunovsky G., Vovchenko R., Gladkikh D., Furman V., Gallagher H., Makmakhon V., Morrow R., De Oliveira I. S., Stickings A., Elliot D., Matanda E., Adrian T., Liang N. we systematized a list of hybrid and internal threats to financial institutions\u2019 economic security. In the paper, we used analysis techniques to establish trends in the number of bank and non-bank financial institutions in Ukraine during the last four years (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017). A list of internal threats to financial intermediaries\u2019 economic security has been generated while using information, obtained through comparing data from the survey and questionnaire of respondents \u2013 experts in the field of financial institutions economic and financial security management. Top management representatives of various types of professional financial market participants were interviewed during 2015, 2016, 2017; their answers have been analysed and the most significant threats to the normal functioning of the financial sector, and hence to the state financial security, have been identified. Results of the survey. It is established what threats to financial institutions economic security, and as a consequence, to the state financial security, can be called traditional ones. Hybrid threats to the Ukrainian financial market and its participants are systematized. The internal threats to the economic security of financial institutions are specified. Thus, the range of threats to the state financial security, the origin of which is the professional activity of economic entities in the financial market, is found out. Practical implications. Today, financial institutions are characterized by a large number of traditional and new threats to economic security, which they should learn in order to cope with because without this action their stable work will be impossible and it will also reduce the level of the country financial security. The list of threats found in the study can be used as an informational basis for the development of state strategies for ensuring the financial security of the state over the next five years. Value/originality. For the first time since gaining independence, Ukraine is experiencing a period of financial instability associated with military actions and the crisis of political power. To traditional threats to economic and financial security at the micro and macro levels, their new variations are added. They can only be detected in a timely manner by an expert in the field of security science and by a specialist in the practice field of managing a financial institution. The result of this study is a synergy of theoretical and practical specialists\u2019 efforts towards the search for effective approaches to the regulation of the state financial security through the threat-oriented management of financial institutions.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.30525/2256-0742/2018-4-3-80-87", "venue": null, "journal": "Baltic Journal of Economic Studies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2897689052", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["158084410"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:169777187"}

We focus on differences between preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and two recent innovations: plans that feature a narrow panel of providers, and plans that allow free choice of providers but increase demand-side cost sharing: consumer-driven/high-deductible health plans. Health plan effect estimates change dramatically after controlling for endogenous plan type choice, and individual fixed effects. With these controls, narrow panel plans reduce the probability of new treatment spells relative to PPOs by 34 percent with little effect on chronic, repeat visit spells. Visit reductions are more concentrated in less severe conditions in narrow network plans, hence diagnostic coding on the remaining patients increases. We find no evidence that either narrow panel or higher cost sharing plans pay lower prices per procedure or have less intensive treatment given initiation of treatment.

The exploration of the compilation of natural resources balance sheet has been proposed since 2013. Several elements of water resources balance sheet have been discussed positively in China, including basic concept, framework and accounting methods, which focused on calculating the amount of water resources with statistical methods but lacked the analysis of the interrelationship between physical volume and magnitude of value. Based on the study of physical accounting of water resources balance sheet, the connotation of water resources value is analyzed in combination with research on the value of water resources in the world. What's more, the theoretical framework, form of measurement and research methods of water resources value accounting are further explored. Taking Chengdu, China as an example, the index system of water resources balance sheet in Chengdu which includes both physical and valuable volume is established to account the depletion of water resources, environmental damage and ecological water occupation caused by economic and social water use. Moreover, the water resources balance sheet in this region which reflects the negative impact of the economy on the environment is established.

We classified patient portal activity into eight functional categories: Appointment, Billing, Document Access, Genetics, Health Result, Immunization, Medication, and Messaging. We describe our operating policies and measure portal uptake, patient account activity, and function use over time. ::: ::: ::: Results ::: By the end of the study period, there were 375 517 registered accounts. Policies made MHAV available to competent adults and adolescents 13 and over. Patients signed up for a limited access account online, which could be upgraded to a full-access account after identity verification. Patients could assign proxy accounts to family and caregivers, which permitted nonpatient access to select MHAV functions. Laboratory and radiology results were accessible via MHAV. Results were classified into three groups based on sensitivity, which govern the length of delay before results appeared in MHAV. ::: ::: ::: Discussion and Conclusion ::: Patient portals offer significant opportunity to engage patients in their healthcare.

The traditional weighted cost of capital (top-down) approach used in the estimation of Mexico's economic opportunity cost of capital is reviewed and compared to the supply price (bottom-up) approach. With respect to previous studies using the top-down approach, this paper explores the contribution of domestic savings and expands the analysis to include a more detailed examination of the available macroeconomic, labor, financial, and tax information. The re-estimated top-down economic opportunity cost of capital for Mexico comes to 10.4 percent. To confirm these results and provide additional insights regarding the alternative bottom-up approach, the economic opportunity cost of capital is estimated using the supply price plus externalities method. For the case of Mexico, this paper recommends using a combination of estimation models (both the top-down and bottom-up approaches) to check the consistency of results and re-estimating the economic opportunity cost of capital every five years to accommodate for macroeconomic and fiscal changes. More broadly, the paper acknowledges the complexities involved in the estimation of the economic opportunity cost of capital for public investment projects and underlines the relevance of additional considerations, such as changes in global economic trends and country risk ratings, tax distortions, financial sector improvements, the impact of reforms, and data availability.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1596/1813-9450-6816", "venue": "Policy Research Working Papers", "journal": "Policy Research Working Papers", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1879399960", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["17494385", "53963715", "9329404", "154037382", "154662410", "154121103", "56218554", "159087054", "156630518", "152916722", "152775726", "1904447", "14423855", "172688957", "154334842", "153998410", "154436136"], "inbound_citations": ["155369273", "59505958", "199524466"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167193405"}

We describe how a crisis management approach that initially focused on avoiding a debt restructuring at almost any cost morphed into the largest sovereign debt exchange operation in history, followed only 9 months later by a buyback of over half of the newly issued bonds. We analyse the distributional consequences of the exchange for creditors and the Greek government and the legal techniques that were used to achieve high creditor participations, and distil lessons for future restructurings in Europe. Our main finding is that the aggregate creditor haircut of the March/April exchange was 58-65 per cent, considerably lower than the numbers reported in the press, but still enough to warrant considerable debt relief for Greece, in the order of 44 to 53 per cent of GDP. By offering the same package for all bonds regardless of maturity, the exchange resulted in a very unequal distribution of losses, ranging from close to 80 per cent on very short term bonds to no haircut at all on Greece\u2019s longest dated bond. Further novelties were the legal technique used (retroactive collective action clauses and a seniority upgrade), and the very high portion of cash transferred to creditors (financed by the EFSF). We find that although Greece could have done better by negotiating the terms of the December 2012 buyback rather than conducting it at market prices, the buyback was no \u201cboondoggle\u201d, achieving debt relief of 6-11 per cent of GDP. We conclude that although the restructurings were successful in achieving deep debt relief in an orderly manner \u2013 no small feat \u2013 their timing and design left money on the table and raise questions about crisis management in Europe. Looking forward, the techniques used in Greece are unlikely to work as a template, indicating the need for a more systematic approach to future sovereign debt restructurings. * EBRD and CEPR, University of Munich and CESifo, and Duke University, and respectively.

It is expected that certain mechanisms will be developed in order to overcome this information asymmetry.

This paper reviews an economic role of education as a signal in the labour market. The goal of the paper is to show theoretically how education can play the role of signal in order to solve the problems caused by the asymmetric information. The importance of such analysis is reflected in the fact that the recommendations for educational policy makers in terms of investment in education are different depending on whether education serves as a mechanism for improving productivity or as a mechanism for signalling different productive capacity. It is shown that these differences arise from distinct ways of measuring social rates of return on investment in education.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1515/ethemes-2017-0021", "venue": null, "journal": "Economic Themes", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2773039149", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["6738765", "155388499", "154544996", "153882868", "16816643", "153112287", "154330951", "155578203", "14286790", "154735503", "153435494", "54091386"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:168949254"}

One of those cryptocurrency products is Inacoin which is originated from Indonesia. Because this cryptocurrency is a contemporary problem that cannot be concluded directly from the classical fiqh book, a thorough investigation is needed to obtain the validity of this money from Islamic perspective. This research is a qualitative research that uses multimethod of normative-empirical Islamic law perspective in discussing the aforementioned problem. This study concluded that the existence of Inacoin cannot be accepted as money since there are Islamic requirements or criteria that are not met. In addition, the use of Inacoin is mostly for trading commodity, not as money.

Behaviours that signify resistance to the rules according to which benefits are allocated prompt us to consider causal links and feedbacks between benefits, perceptions of benefits, meanings attached to the benefits, and the regulatory instruments that mediate the distribution of benefits. An understanding of how meanings influence the perception of benefits exposes the complexity inherent in how people perceive and allocate value to natural resource benefits. Meanings are personal, sometimes overlapping, context dependent and variable across space and time. A challenge in directing resource user behaviour in common pool resources is that the relationship between the resource and resource use is typically not interpreted to include the manner in which users associate resource benefits with meanings. We propose that collective ordering of meanings and associated rules help to direct behaviours and in doing so they contribute to the purposeful maintenance of desirable elements of a social-ecological system (i.e. robustness). Using an example, we illustrate how tensions around benefit sharing are rooted in the emergence and changing prioritisation of contexts and meanings over time. The importance of eliciting, ordering and sanctioning of meanings is emphasised.

I use the unprecedented changes in the degree of competition in local banking markets that occurred after 1980 to estimate the impact of market competition on the risk profile of commercial bank lending. I find evidence that increasing concentration has been associated with reductions in the flow of bank capital to construction and land development loans, the highest-risk category of commercial bank loans. The magnitude of this effect is large: an increase in concentration from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the sample distribution is associated with a 15 percent drop in the share of bank lending going to construction loans. Robustness to a variety of econometric strategies supports a causal interpretation of this empirical relationship. Increasing concentration also appears to increase average bank capitalization, raise the average share of assets loaned out to borrowers, and reduce bank failure rates during this period.

This paper describes the protocol of an ongoing retrospective study of the attrition rate, physical integrity and bioefficacy of three polyester LLIN products that were distributed during 2010 to 2013 in Nepal. It is hoped that robust and auditable data on net survival (physical integrity and bioefficacy) of these three brands in different environments will assist the Nepal National Malaria Control Programme in planning future LLIN-replacement strategies, including behaviour-change communication about LLIN care and maintenance. The advantages and disadvantages of prospective and retrospective cross-sectional approaches are discussed, including appropriate strategies to validate the timing for mass distribution of nets.

They track the impacts of two treatments -- training only and training plus a cash grant -- over two years with four follow-up surveys and find that the short and medium-term impacts differ. For women already in business, training alone leads to some changes in business practices but has no impact on business profits, sales or capital stock. In contrast, the combination of training and a grant leads to large and significant improvements in business profitability in the first eight months, but this impact dissipates in the second year. For women interested in starting enterprises, business training speeds up entry but leads to no increase in net business ownership by the final survey round. Both profitability and business practices of the new entrants are increased by training, suggesting training may be more effective for new owners than for existing businesses.

For two countries more similar than different in terms of geography, location, government and culture, Canada and the U.S. remain strikingly different in terms of housing finance. Public policy objectives toward housing followed quite different paths over the past seventy years and fundamental differences in banking practices have led to considerably different outcomes in terms of mortgage finance instruments in the two countries. In light of that, it is particularly surprising that homeownership rates do not diverge by much, reaching 67% in the United States and 64% in Canada by year-end 2000. We examine some of the differences in policy and in competitive practices between Canada and the U.S. in an attempt to illuminate why differences in rates and terms across the two countries still exist.

This paper simulates the terminal wealth outcomes under different static asset allocation strategies to evaluate their relative appeal as default investment choice in DC plans. We find that strategies with low or moderate allocation to stocks are consistently outperformed in terms of upside potential of exceeding the participant\u2019s wealth accumulation target at retirement as well as downside risk of falling below that target outcome by aggressive strategies whose allocation to stocks approach 100%. The risk of extremely adverse wealth outcomes for plan participants also does not appear to be very sensitive to asset allocation.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of both competition and cooperation, i.e. coopetition, on agglomeration and store performance. Drawing on the network debate, this paper develops a conceptual model and tests it in three distinctive agglomerations, each in an urban setting, namely first- and second-order high streets as well as an inner-city retail and service cluster. A total of 277 store managers served as key informants in our survey. Variance-based structural equation modelling reveals that both competition and cooperation improve agglomeration performance directly. Despite competition having a negative direct effect on stores' performance, the overall effect is insignificant. Cooperation affects store performance positively but only indirectly. The contribution of this paper is to reveal and substantiate the complex nature and benefits of the effects of the coopetition of stores located within agglomerations. More widely it underlines the importance of managers of agglomerations understanding the differing effects of competition and cooperation and using this understanding in their management decision making.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.indmarman.2015.07.010", "venue": null, "journal": "Industrial Marketing Management", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1908736097", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["167774533", "189887782", "167526254", "199331872", "1925599", "167814310", "167971321", "17210507", "855944", "14079552", "153413447", "59850202", "154447294", "123217261", "167630824", "109815317", "109044604", "167965404", "153387643", "168139204", "154099705", "145292856", "153956033", "142917893", "57987706", "167339931", "167672022", "143902821", "6409690", "121915589", "167657370", "167704919", "167954010", "44326519", "122391393", "55322231", "167944560", "145074976", "168050748", "167535495", "167785414", "17605924", "56422471", "167619233", "167505064", "28677876", "154668542", "91176958", "5281538", "145740592", "14627333", "56329212", "9829233", "153494901", "15668476", "140969554", "2839729", "167656838", "10667020", "168088222", "6138250", "18580126", "14388750", "12047276", "53793536", "167846037", "168085680", "168106892", "167969167", "18727889", "143446032", "203467018", "167682979", "15752738", "167550054"], "inbound_citations": ["55058393", "9019266", "15473965", "53598119", "211531339", "167215729"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:85539114"}

While in the past the studies in this context have typically concentrated on the contents of methods in isolation, there is a growing trend towards methodological perspectives that support the linking of such methods. The focus here is on the combination of discrete multicriteria approaches used for handling qualitative information in a sequence of steps: the regime method, the evamix method and rough-set analysis. The first two methods will be used to obtain a ranking of four alternative scenarios of agri-environmental policies in a selected area of study, in this case, Sicily. The results obtained are discussed and re-analysed by using the rough-set approach as a recent meta-analytical tool. Finally, the analysis findings are applied to an investigation into the potential effectiveness of agricultural policies in promoting sustainable rural development in Sicily.", "year": 2003, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1108/14777830310460423", "venue": null, "journal": "Management of Environmental Quality: An International Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2256466141,2149798046", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Engineering"], "outbound_citations": ["62145586", "153032560", "98105273", "154536561", "128878046", "108922546", "152977911", "135012269", "168206033", "190445019"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16502048"}

A computational model is developed in which store managers continually search for better practices. In a decentralized organization, a store manager adopts a new practice if it raises her store's profit. Headquarters (HQ) is assumed to observe the new practice and then decides whether to disseminate it to other stores. In a centralized organization, a store manager who generates an idea that would raise her store's profit passes the idea up to HQ for approval. Due to lack of detailed information about stores' markets, HQ decides whether or not to mandate it across the chain on the basis of chain profit. Given that stores are assumed to have heterogenous markets, the obvious virtue to decentralization is that it gives authority to those who have the best information and this allows practices to be tailored to each market. What our analysis reveals, however, is the presence of an implicit cost to decentralization. Allowing stores the freedom to develop very different practices is shown to reduce the amount of inter-store learning; that is, the frequency with which one store's idea is of value to another store. By keeping stores near each other in store practice space, centralization enhances learning spillovers and, in some cases, this results in higher chain profit than is achieved under decentralization. We find that centralization outperforms when stores' markets are not too different, consumer demand is sufficiently sensitive to a store's practices, and markets are changing sufficiently rapidly over time.", "year": 2000, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1287/mnsc.46.11.1427.12085", "venue": "MANAGEMENT SCIENCE", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2113397902,1553986629", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["492484", "153459058", "14281964", "155261545", "154619190", "173057177", "204479570", "167584809", "153605447", "152719664", "166467170", "145679798", "154348182", "151056822", "154226254", "153459672", "152598843"], "inbound_citations": ["12670770", "202320623", "1539124", "34533309", "7748842", "55194632", "13559080", "18433402", "28943174", "43994013", "4388622", "154854455", "6296063", "26694474", "88501519", "6584139", "146803975", "55097110", "198175229", "27689896", "18772587", "19037351", "821200", "14111848", "166968523", "19640560", "476930", "169565986", "154583623", "54022688"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:16502088"}

The article looks at the operational implications of the SFDRR text and covers issues of including migrants in DRR work; informing urban development about current and future mobility trends; managing relocations, evacuations, and displacement to prevent future risks and reduce existing ones; and preparing for and managing disaster-induced population movements to reduce the direct and indirect impacts of natural hazards. Overall, the references to human mobility within the SFDRR show an evolution in the way the issue is considered within global policy dialogues. Both the potential of population movements to produce risk and their role in strengthening the resilience of people and communities are now clearly recognized. This is an evolution of previously prevailing views of mobility as the consequence of disasters or as a driver of risk.

Several new firm-level models of international trade with heterogeneous firms predict that industry productivity will rise as trade costs fall due to the reallocation of activity across plants within an industry. Using disaggregated U.S. import data, we create a new measure of trade costs over time and industries. As the models predict, productivity growth is faster in industries with falling trade costs.

The ABC Waters Program provides valuable lessons for other high-density cities to overcome land scarcity as a constraint on BGI. With a shortage of green spaces, high-density cities should strive to optimize the existing green spaces in the provision of ecosystem services and to leverage cultural ecosystem services to engage citizens and gain public support.

In our model single-product firms which supply different products can merge to form a multiproduct firm. Consumers wish to buy multiple products and value the one-stop shopping convenience associated with a multiproduct firm. We find that when the search friction is relatively large all firms are multiproduct in equilibrium. However when the search friction is smaller the equilibrium market structure is asymmetric, with single-product and multiproduct firms coexisting. This asymmetric market structure often leads to the weakest price competition, and is the worst for consumers among all possible market structures.

However, many households are still confronted with availability constraints in childcare. In the recent past, many governments implemented policy reforms in order to increase the coverage rate of childcare. The empirical part of this paper focuses on the Flemish childcare market and analyzes how maternal labour supply and childcare usage is affected by a new Flemish decree which provides full childcare coverage. This paper adopts a modeling framework for analyzing labour supply developed by Aaberge, Colombino and Strom (1999) and Dagsvik (1994). To account for the possible interaction between labour supply and childcare choices the model also treats childcare type as an endogenous variable. The results of the policy reform analysis show that households switch to formal childcare when confronted with higher childcare availability. Total labour supply also increases but these effects are less pronounced as some households also reduce working hours.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2381527", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1832545411", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["152529424", "55284751", "151067037", "153423043", "154948271", "153632375", "42351166", "884191", "54498585", "15003105", "154579130", "30345371", "55338940", "153283791", "15986709", "153825251", "153956887", "153296073", "153681937", "154978375", "37046713"], "inbound_citations": ["45199001", "157989071", "168164393"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:28213358"}

Partnering or contracting with universities for innovation is common practice for developing new -original- knowledge, as opposed to applying existing knowledge to a problem. But firms are more reluctant to partner, especially with other firms, when that knowledge directly enhances their competitiveness. However, conditional on cooperation, partners are more likely to act individually when the project is strategically important.

While the survey highlighted that funding is predominantly from government sources, there is growing interest in the diversification of funding sources to meet service demand, enable service innovation and attain agency sustainability. Flexibility and discretion of funding utilisation is favoured by agencies to meet service objectives. Summary of key findings: Of the 398 Specialist Homelessness Services (SHS) (response rate 35.5%) that completed the survey \u2013 298 of these provided organisational funding information (298 SHS represent approximately 20% of the services in the AIHW data collection) \u2013 while 216 provided funding dollar amounts. Also a small sample of 21 non-SHS provided funding information (with 17 providing funding dollar amounts). As this sample is likely to be unrepresentative, any findings in relation to these providers should be treated with caution and not directly compared to the SHS findings. Services profile \u2013 of the SHS and non-SHS respondent services (n=319) 17.7% of respondent services were homelessness specific agencies with 70.7% providing a mix of homelessness and non-homelessness services. Annual revenue of these services comprised: 21.9% less than $1m, 30.2% $1m\u2013$5m and 47.9% greater than $5m. Funding profile (n=216 SHS that provided funding dollar amounts) \u2013 not surprisingly, 84.6% of funding received by SHS comes from government (49.5% via NAHA or NPAH). A further 5.2% government and 2.7% non-government funding is allocated by the parent agency. Only 3.6% of funding came from donations, philanthropy and sponsorships. Rent contributed to 92% of internally generated revenue. However this makes up only 2.4% of the total (internal plus external) funding source. For non-SHS (n=17) 60.6% of total funding came from government and 21.3% from donations/sponsorship/philanthropy. 75.6% of internally generated revenue came from social enterprise however this was only 0.7% of total funding. No SHS or non-SHS reported funding via social impact investors or social impact bonds. The level of unmet demand in the SHS sector suggests that resources are not adequate to meet demand.

Building upon theories from marketing and sociology, we propose that these contributions arise from team members' positions, or embeddedness, in a social network weaved through past film collaborations. These collaborations provide team members with opportunities to draw knowledge and skills from the network for new film projects. Our conceptual framework accentuates two aspects of network embeddedness: positional embeddedness (PE)\u2014how well a person is tied to well-connected others, and junctional embeddedness (JE)\u2014the extent to which a person bridges sub-communities in the industry. We examine how the importance of PE and JE varies by functional role (cast versus crew), and is moderated by the film's studio affiliation. Analyzing more than 15,000 industry professionals over nearly two decades of film collaborations, this research reveals crucial and divergent relationships: while high PE is more valuable for the cast, high JE is critical for the crew. This role distinction also depends on a film's studio affiliation.

It appears that the current Pension Insurance Modeling System (PIMS) approach to modeling risk does a reasonable job of capturing its statistical properties effects on PBGC cash flows, though some aspects of the might be improved and metrics expanded. The paper outlines how an options-based approach to modeling the joint distribution of defaults and underfunding in PIMS might be implemented while preserving the strengths of the current model.

Inclusion criteria were: (1) opening in response to the Katrina disaster; (2) operating for more than three weeks; and (3) being a FBO. Enrolled shelters were examined using descriptive data methods. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: The majority of shelters operating in Mississippi up to three weeks post-Katrina were FBO-managed. All of the operating FBO shelters in Mississippi that met the inclusion criteria were contacted with a response rate of 94%. Decisions were made by individuals or small groups in most shelters regarding opening, operating procedures, and closing. Most FBOs provided at least one enabling service to evacuees, and all utilized informal networks for sheltering operations. Only 25% of FBOs had disaster plans in place prior to Hurricane Katrina. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSIONS ::: Faith-based organization shelters played a significant role in the acute phase of the Katrina disaster. Formal disaster training should be initiated for these organizations. Services provided by FBOs should be standardized. Informal networks should be incorporated into national disaster planning.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "18491661", "doi": "10.1017/S1049023X00005550", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2166865632", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Business"], "outbound_citations": ["37518821", "154856856", "32751037", "7508511"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:38617745"}

To better understand how small and medium-sized enterprises achieve ambidexterity, we develop theoretical arguments that link organizational performance to strategic combinations of exploration and exploitation in both product and market domains. We test the hypotheses with a longitudinal study in a dynamic industry that combines objective measures of competition, firm size, age, and revenue performance with self-reported measures of product and market exploration and exploitation. The empirical results offer new insights with respect to several tensions at the heart of the ambidexterity challenge: (1) pure strategies that combine product exploration with market exploration or product exploitation with market exploitation have complementary interaction effects on revenue, (2) cross-functional ambidexterity combining product exploitation with market exploration also exerts complementary interaction effects on revenue, (3) product ambidexterity has positive effects on revenue for older and larger\u2014but not younger and smaller\u2014firms, and (4) market ambidexterity has positive effects on revenue for larger\u2014but not smaller, younger, or older\u2014firms. Two ambidexterity paradoxes emerge: (1) larger, older firms have the resources, capabilities, and experience required to benefit from a product ambidexterity strategy, but larger, older firms are less likely to implement product ambidexterity; and (2) only larger firms have the resources and capabilities required to benefit from a market ambidexterity strategy, but developing and sustaining market ambidexterity is necessary to drive long-term growth.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1287/orsc.1120.0790", "venue": "Organization Science", "journal": "Organization Science", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2096780401", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14901622", "201889917", "15773886", "55835549", "24631281", "168549230", "168038821", "16239365", "46347949", "167907737", "167631579", "53452137", "12718242", "15839045", "43651281", "30028243", "6255046", "62753863", "167911255", "7826562", "167927695", "56307758", "167878434", "53370475", "121989517", "15758009", "154119145", "18177879", "19318742", "156688207", "10170260", "167714149", "14996713", "156396112", "169565986", "145665441", "14032712", "36543082", "154099149", "153517185", "153498140", "167995517", "50386876", "16477972", "20533667", "17463469"], "inbound_citations": ["38900062", "215460411", "15495851", "61680133", "55852362", "52020409", "157586617", "159201370", "159266929", "11943656", "167872394", "203328828", "52232131", "18690123", "199392821", "209378693", "158856990", "54795912", "17357308", "16695199", "25863405", "55336667", "39212334", "52014126", "67774868", "158370538", "55816367", "203650792", "55734062", "6651302", "45531395"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:13608914"}

This whole debate of the agro based industries can be traced back to the economic development of the developing economies around the world. India has been basically an agriculture driven economy, the story of the development of the other agriculture driven economies suggest that they stated their development story with the view of also taking agriculture growth into account. They led to the path of development i.e. industrial sector and services sector but also took along agriculture with itself. This step was taken to make the growth process inclusive, that is development of all the sectors composing the economy at that point in time. But in india the growth process has not been inclusive that is, the urban centers has marched ahead while the rural sector stays behind. The development of industrial sectors has been centralized along the urban areas. This imbalance has led to a flourishing urban centre and a ruining rural centre. Now this imbalance has led to the problem of migration, unemployment in rural centres, underemployment in rural centres, acute poverty. So to tackle this problem of rural distress industrialization of rural india is a necessity and along with it growth of agriculture is also required. To tackle this dual problem the development of agro based industries is a necessity.

Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A general review of the literature on sustainable operations and on the impact of reverse logistics on SC performance provides the foundation for the study. The authors use difference equation math approach for modelling and analysing a closed SC. A proper design of experiment and data collected from the European Union statistics validate the obtained numerical results. Findings \u2013 The variability of reverse flow in a closed loop SC increases the serviceable inventory variance.

The data was collected from the Banking sector of Pakistan. The questionnaires were used to collect the data. Convenience sampling was used in this study. The sample size of the study was 400 but we had received only 250. After applying regression and correlation we found that internal marketing have positive relationship with job satisfaction and employee engagement also have positive relationship as mediator. I. Introduction In the present era, services have become key to success in the fiscal progressions of countries worldwide. During the decade of 1980\"s, many nations had faced abolishment of services specially in banking, insurance, telecommunication, transport and healthcare, which in return ultimately gave rise to a firm competition among various business. At that time many organizations felt the need to diversify and devise different marketing strategies for the satisfaction of customers. Thus in such a varying situation, survival of the fittest was pushed to be the key to sustainability. Internal marketing was first proposed as a solution to the problem of delivering high quality service. According to this concept, the human resource of an organization which affects the quality of customer service being delivered. Internal marketing is part of the marketing strategy with the employee\"s themselves act as internal customers. It is used as a philosophy for managing human resource of the firm by satisfying their necessities so that they work with utmost dedication and devotion and pave way for the company\"s success. The fifth \"P\" in services marketing mix is People who are a vital constituent to any service provision. If an organization wants to obtain a form of competitive advantage, it needs to recruit the right staff and train them effectively in their service delivery. Recently more emphasis is lied on providing good services to the employees of the organization than its customers. Employee Engagement is the level of commitment of employee on both emotional and intellectual grounds fulfilling all the requirements of work place making sure mission and vision of the company are met at all times. It can also be defined as owing the company in such a manner that it will benefit both the external and internal leading to success of the company. The concept was derived by Schmidt et al. (1993), describing it as modern version of job satisfaction. They defined it as \"an employee's involvement with, commitment to, and satisfaction with work. Employee engagement is a part of employee retention.\" It further integrated the concept of job satisfaction with the organizational commitment (Smith et al., 1969) (Meyer & Allen, 1991). The banking industry is going through drastic revolution worldwide mainly due to the relaxation in economic restrictions, private sector ownerships and growth on worldwide scale. The Pakistani banking industry is part of all this. Banks area pivotal to the fiscal development of present countries. Conventionally, in Pakistan private participation is limited for banks as compared to banks in public sector. During the decade of 1990, circumstances got changed in the banking sector industry. Technological advancements had an incredible impact on the operations of commercial banks in the public sector of Pakistan by pioneering the concept of Mobile banking services in order to fulfill the emerging needs and facilitate clients. Like other economical service industries, the banking industry is facing some unique challenges including unpredictable market, innovations, financial volatility, furious rivalry and needs and desires of consumers. Banking is included in service industry thus its distinguishing factors are its customers and how they are being served. Employees dealing directly with customers should be acquainted with the basic know how of handling and satisfying their customers.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.9790/487X-0826268", "venue": null, "journal": "IOSR Journal of Business and Management", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2336258849", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["168439895", "167982173", "55305620", "23560487", "167753061", "167515466", "167318153"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:29841657"}

These methods are the basis for the development of a theory for assessing audit risks in carrying out tax audits Keywords: methodological provision, qualitative assessment, audit risk, tax audit, tax reporting, asymmetric information.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.9770/jesi.2018.6.1(23)", "venue": null, "journal": "Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2892735787", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["154173489", "6738765", "158314007", "11736831", "155055259", "153585495", "197882340", "146735250", "204413642", "151668761", "67776019", "14286790", "154189376", "154554916", "116784395"], "inbound_citations": ["211569969", "203188335", "202716511", "204440904", "169972238", "195490784"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:145029188"}

The efficient markets view is that low stock price means poor fundamentals, a higher cost of capital, and lower inventory. Normatively, firms should obtain their cost of capital from an efficient markets model of stock prices. My study is motivated by the growing body of evidence that the stock market is not efficient and can temporarily mis-value firms. I report evidence that the market's behavioral component explains firms' inventory as much as its fundamentals component. I further test three possibilities for how the behavioral component works. The first is a financing channel. When the market over-values firms, firms can get cheaper financing and increase inventory. The second is dissipation. When the market mis-values firms, firms are less disciplined and let inventories rise. The third is catering. When the market discounts high-inventory firms, firms decrease inventory, and vice versa. I report evidence that weakly supports financing, rejects dissipation and strongly supports catering. The findings suggest that we need to find new ways of calculating the cost of capital for operations models. They could begin to form the basis of a more empirically accurate account of how inventory decisions are affected by financial markets.", "year": 2006, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.789884", "venue": null, "journal": "The Finance", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2251513119,1688464102", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["133436", "40246195", "569554", "11050305", "17623242", "2211741", "10599951", "154007515", "153763322", "56326427", "12112860", "150514825", "1808264", "150614019", "154971216", "153581884", "153660491", "53399844", "153826188", "167862027", "154058316"], "inbound_citations": ["55623919", "53360064", "59153271"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:53478707"}

Repatriations did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R&D -- even for the firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions and for firms that appeared to be financially constrained. Instead, a $1 increase in repatriations was associated with an increase of almost $1 in payouts to shareholders.

As time has gone by, this lack of accountability has undermined marketers\u2019 credibility, threatened the standing of the marketing function within the firm, and even threatened marketing\u2019s existence as a distinct capability within the firm. This article proposes a broad framework for assessing marketing productivity, cataloging what is already known, and suggesting areas for further research. The authors conclude that it is possible to show how marketing expenditures add to shareholder value. The effective dissemination of new methods of assessing marketing productivity to the business community will be a major step toward raising marketing\u2019s vitality in the firm and, more important, toward raising the performance of the firm itself. The authors also suggest many areas in which further research is essential to making methods of evaluating marketing productivity increasingly valid,...", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1509/jmkg.68.4.76.42721", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Marketing", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2193038455", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["18797994", "144672532", "167318901", "167964616", "51304337", "167963686", "167736774", "151254748", "168153455", "55150074", "55938593", "167549880", "167505454", "167814667", "167396766", "144465013", "167601648", "154421592", "41067168", "167910807", "167172480", "167416965", "42912699", "17782869", "154716322", "17434734", "167552447", "167355767", "154654760", "108469486", "168624154", "167614323", "154434555", "15314704", "166526709", "154734414", "153725896", "32178222", "168598177", "197870386", "168327951", "168152957", "166388638", "2851614", "167610522", "154598324", "153580716", "166530122", "143857363", "153599204", "168143997", "167303410", "167753910", "144219695", "8705211", "169498138", "167586931", "154842758", "167593293", "13880182", "156571530", "167448164", "121141988", "167553959", "154058316", "166369158", "37443428", "46916448", "154695326"], "inbound_citations": ["51736191", "54758432", "55643543", "41853227", "55226236", "167389990", "3201274", "55669920", "6292391", "56249828", "51978773", "16997325", "45639643", "169286342", "154734235", "55859681", "167356988", "38746136", "160022937", "154327953", "36681958", "26927242", "109939389", "156392580", "169114475", "53981049", "166450099", "19287572", "55270202", "144693688", "59398963", "168150869", "168426508", "8395293", "55264092", "56167186", "55841153", "149762844", "54039943", "169272829", "15261214", "167521675", "67177966", "55371774", "9903497", "56318608", "152922604", "196701123", "54788024", "132376878", "59174468", "157504543", "30974358", "62797376", "158277340", "152753657", "18952445", "4652304", "67803753", "59135358", "197865665", "46041578", "168972680", "18469605", "54684681", "154145775", "167884438", "203646812", "167775037", "53370075", "55137520", "153975814", "167595240", "15393758", "54054376", "58899912", "55931674", "167762435", "3777821", "73517908", "6913086", "157274657", "147703029", "14584443", "153638390", "37813591", "17079870", "31036092", "17632622", "7274865", "155202287", "169166568", "53388648", "167960104", "59448540", "56399229", "55882871", "6386770", "145465045", "16793698", "6076876", "18321443", "6485690", "158276237", "62884433", "14495987", "54826651", "1705975", "168920067", "55881208", "27553080", "27553080", "55270462", "17362111", "56321096", "156362094", "55289113", "56030928", "154630799", "7049294", "169590613", "9256453", "55767983", "4737175", "39772719", "39244363", "55600574", "154395503", "54895908", "56197858", "10428169", "143604880", "189869061", "85534956", "169337968", "169337968", "55200230", "55162201", "66195889", "12963938", "14274865", "153320703", "55785700", "53627525", "73582987", "17491841", "168699168", "85454655", "169999050", "199478684", "215714202", "156338000", "35808309", "160018234", "32241222", "10230763", "37456024", "59142880", "54080017", "149573960", "2839729", "56345001", "55831496", "59405680", "15345561", "166721724", "154835478", "5735452", "55788241", "43097709", "59042781", "56027499", "169586627", "55146375", "55053240", "54571754", "55309874", "22086255", "2784060", "64063360", "41366611", "13966355", "167476361", "11355452", "44279433", "54705130", "55845628", "67830348", "56535642", "16743380", "24798155", "168666753", "169364585", "202726538", "16777235", "51789874", "54784637", "1647295", "198950373", "16459712", "214716739", "167945992", "55587445", "55812520", "215372323", "167816137", "157883738", "53698885", "51820913", "33071117", "56335944", "167611641", "96427322", "59492361", "55840984", "1868999", "54044537", "8901074", "154742185", "214637137", "154239704", "96453273", "46987428", "626613", "626613", "20816453", "145027786", "56150337", "73576103", "55660771", "8267130", "58897324", "54760691", "5795214", "16245692", "52062412"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:15531302"}

To fulfil domestic mitigation targets efficiently, policymakers have typically focused on two market-based regulatory mechanisms: taxes and caps with trading. Both policy measures will create a similar carbon price on the combustion of fossil fuels and therefore increase the domestic production costs of energy-intensive industries. Because the Kyoto Protocol does not require mitigation from developing countries, such asymmetric climate policies will lead to changes in terms of trade. Firms located in countries which implement carbon pricing policies will bear an additional production cost and are placed at a disadvantageous position comparing with their competitors in countries which do not internalise the carbon costs in production. Facing an increase in production cost, firms can choose to pass carbon related costs onto their downstream consumers or to cut their profit margins in order to keep the market share. Both options will however lead to losses in both international competitiveness and employment. An alternative way of produce domestically is to relocate production to countries with less stringent climate policies. Relocation may help to address losses in competitiveness but in employment. Another concern closely related to the competitiveness losses and relocation is \u201ccarbon leakage\u201d, which generally refers to an increase of emissions in countries without climate policies that are attributable to emission reductions in countries with climate policies. The effectiveness of climate polices on reducing global emissions will be undermined if the leakage is high. The competitiveness and leakage concerns have centred in the climate policy debates first in EU when EU Emissions Trading System was introduced and implemented, then in US and Australia when a cap-and-trade system is being considered (Houser et al., 2008; Reinaud, 2008; Carbon Trust 2010; van Asselt & Brewer, 2010). The best way to address these concerns in implementing carbon pricing policies would be the completion of a harmonized international climate policy (Stern, 2006; Manders & Veenendaal, 2008). However differences between countries in the level of economic development, political conditions, obligations stemming from historic emissions, and responsibilities arising from current and future emissions mean that harmonization is still a long way off.

This research study is related to both theory and practice. The main relevance lies in analyzing the relationship between HPMP and sustainability outcomes in SMEs. This research study relates to theory by applying the resource-based view and configurational approaches used in this study. The study employed a quantitative methodology. Data were collected through a self-administered survey questionnaire. The questionnaire was adopted from a previous validated survey measuring HPMP in Australian SMEs. The target population consisted of SMEs operating in the city of Karachi, Pakistan. Stratified random sampling was applied to collect data from two stratums i.e. manufacturing and service-sector SMEs. A total of 703 firms were selected, contacted by phone, and invited to participate in this survey. Of these firms, 357 SMEs (50.78 percent response rate) accepted the invitation to fill out the survey questionnaire. Most of the respondents who agreed requested that the researcher to visit their organizations personally.

Locations of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in determining their survival. SMEs agglomerations are often due to natural resource endowments and types of business climate in their environment. The amoebic nature and economic roles they play have made them the bedrock of the micro economy in most economies. This study contributes to the literature on cross-country comparison of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Zhenjiang (China) and in Lagos State (Nigeria).

Land-sparing and land-sharing have emerged as contrasting strategies to manage trade-offs between production and biodiversity conservation. Both strategies are evident in land-management policies at local-to-international scales. However, studies rarely report the impacts of these strategies, assessed for multiple stakeholders and multiple ecosystem services, particularly in real landscapes. Using a case study from a high-priority region for forest protection, restoration and rural development in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we analysed the potential outcomes under 10 alternative policy scenarios, including land-sharing, land-sparing and mixed strategies. We used a novel optimization process integrating integer programming with conservation-planning software (Marxan with Zones) to identify production possibility frontiers (PPFs), highlighting the trade-off between smallholder agriculture and oil palm, subject to achievement of a set of carbon, timber and biodiversity conservation targets. All policy scenarios modelled proved to be capable of achieving all targets simultaneously. Most strategies resulted in an expansion of the PPF from the baseline, increasing the flexibility of land allocation to achieve all targets. Mixed strategies gave the greatest flexibility to achieve targets, followed closely by land-sparing. Land-sharing only performed better than the baseline when no yield penalties were incurred, and resulted in PPF contraction otherwise. Strategies assessed required a minimum of 29-37 to be placed in conservation zones, notably protecting the majority of remaining forest, but requiring little reforestation. Policy implications. Production possibility frontiers (PPFs) can evaluate a broad spectrum of land-use policy options. When using targets sought by multiple stakeholders within an ecosystem services framework, PPFs can characterize biophysical, socio-economic and institutional dimensions of policy trade-offs in heterogeneous landscapes. All 10 policy strategies assessed in our case study are biophysically capable of achieving all stakeholder objectives, provided at least 29-37 of the landscape is conserved for biodiversity. This novel methodological approach provides practical options for systematic analysis in complex, multifunctional landscapes, and could, when integrated within a larger planning and implementation process, inform the design of land-use policies that maximize stakeholder satisfaction and minimize conflict. \u00c2\u00a9 2016 The Authors.

Currently, only a few research studies have been conducted on strategic planning in developing countries, especially in the Middle East. Almost no evidence of such research exists to understand the extent of the use of strategic planning tools and techniques in the Sultanate of Oman. The study used a questionnaire to ask about 14 strategic planning tools and techniques. Twenty organizations in Oman that have a written strategic plan comprised the sample population. The data were collected from heads of departments and sections, directors, managers, and advisors directly involved in the strategic planning process. The analysis shows that the most commonly used strategic planning tools employed by organizations in Oman are benchmarking, followed by stakeholders analysis and then strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis, while the Delphi technique, experience curve, Porter\u2019s five forces, and what-if analysis techniques were the least commonly used. Considering the segmentation of organizations, one can see that the financial sector and business groups use the tools most frequently whereas the single- and family-ownership groups have limited use of strategic planning tools. On average, almost 30% of the organizations in Oman never or very rarely uses strategic planning tools. This paper provides an understanding of strategic planning in Oman and supplies the missing links in the previous studies conducted on strategic planning.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5539/ibr.v7n3p159", "venue": null, "journal": "International Business Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2019357413", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["2875569", "168135064", "107492132", "167900533", "168053407", "167908966", "167601648", "53765858", "167120038", "167341458", "62291587", "166765586", "154080665", "166840969", "167800934", "54210047", "122032251", "166332314", "166533841", "155891708", "160665259", "60242380", "144824046", "166409442", "109326861", "10093415", "167321656", "154528921", "31204365", "143591418", "153146849", "153925519", "20669314", "168150841", "153870338", "153612511", "54538527", "166262869", "166741997", "154402963", "153292266", "153751448", "154914972", "144823651"], "inbound_citations": ["74869219", "73723248", "55718494", "33561779"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:167638690"}

However, policies that raise tax revenue also harm economic growth. With tax revenue coming mainly from large capital-intensive firms, and with a large informal sector, policies that aid large firms and policies that discourage entry of new firms both help increase tax revenue. Entrepreneurial activity as a result is discouraged, lowering growth. There is a basic tension in policy design between current tax revenue and economic growth. In fact, a loss in tax revenue can itself reduce growth, due to less spending on education and infrastructure. It can also undermine political support for the reforms from the poor and from government bureaucrats, both of whom are key beneficiaries of government expenditures. What policies encourage growth without undue loss of current expenditures? One is debt finance, but this creates the risk of a financial crisis if tax revenue rises too slowly to repay this debt.

Due to the negative impact of floods, we need to pay serious attention and take an alternatives way to reduce this disaster. This paper reviews previous articles relating to flood disaster management in Malaysia based on electronic databases which are subscribed by the university library. The flood disaster management in Malaysia involves four phases, which are prevention/mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery. The disaster prevention/mitigation and preparedness are the best way forward because if these two phases were successfully handled, the burden of the next phases will be reduced. Besides, the agencies responsible for the management of floods in Malaysia have been identified in this study. The usage of technology for managing flood events has also been reviewed.

For example, a consumer who is concerned with limiting expenses may decide before going shopping that he or she only wants to spend approximately $100 for a particular purchase. Although conventional wisdom predicts that self-imposed price restraints will decrease consumer spending, the authors show that salient price restraints can actually increase consumers' preferences for high-priced, high-quality items. The authors propose that making a price restraint salient has the effect of partitioning consumers' evaluations of price and quality, leading to larger differences in perceived quality between options and a greater focus on quality during the final decision. Thus, while budgets and other types of price restraints can limit spending by eliminating some high-priced options from consideration, this research suggests that they can also have the ironic effect of increasing consumers' spending relative to a situa...", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1509/jmr.10.0508", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Marketing Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2945906964", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["1681717", "146457544", "17934027", "15580093", "167460437", "9409946", "144914829", "155048823", "168089379", "21698680", "168141340", "16827760", "152703188", "18785280", "121530840", "154778299", "167810612", "6546894"], "inbound_citations": ["158565011"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:48554130"}

The focus of discussions of the networked organization has been on the boundary spanning nature of these new organizational structures. What has remained unclear is the role of the group in these networked organizations. Furthermore, little is known about how computer-mediated communication is used to bridge group and organizational boundaries. In particular, the role of new media in the context of existing communication patterns has received little attention. We examine how employees at a high-tech company referred to as KME communicate with members of the work group, other colleagues in the organization, and colleagues outside the organization to determine the nature of boundary spanning communication. In addition, at each communication distance we examine the use of different media for communication to determine the role of computer-mediated communication (email and instant messaging) versus traditional means of communication (face-to-face and the phone) in the networked organization. Do employees have the trust to communicate over boundaries using ICTs? We find that boundary spanning communication has not replaced communication with members of the work group at KME. By contrast, a large proportion of communication continues to occur within the boundary of the work group and organization. Surprisingly, these communications within the boundary of the work group and organization take place via computer-mediated means and not via traditional face-to-face and phone interactions. Computer-mediated communication is also used extensively for external communication. The findings suggest that organizations have only partially moved toward a pure form of the networked organization. We propose glocalization as an alternative perspective for understanding these new forms of work: local involvement with global reach.

Within the city logistics subsector, this new model is exemplified by the emergence of Urban Freight Consolidation Centres (UCCs). UCCs replace multiple \u2018last-mile\u2019 delivery movements, many of which involving small consignments, by a common receiving point (the consolidation centre), normally on the periphery of a city, with the final part of the delivery being shared by the consignments in a small freight vehicle. Such arrangements can represent a good compromise between the needs of city centre businesses and their customers on the one hand (i.e. high availability of a range of goods) and local and global sustainability objectives on the other. At the same time, by sharing logistics facilities and delivery vehicles, UCCs offer added-value services to both urban economic actors, such as retailers, and network logistics providers. However, UCCs add to the complexity of logistics chains, requiring additional contracts, communications and movement stages. These arrangements also introduce additional actors within the supply of delivery services, notably local authorities present as promoters and funders, rather than simply as regulators, companies specialised in the UFCC operation, and companies which provide specialist technologies, such as electric delivery vehicles. UCCs therefore also represent an example of multi-stakeholder collaboration. Drawing on the results of a 2013 survey in Bristol (UK) and a further survey carried out in 2015 in Cagliari (IT), the present paper provides an in-depth comparison of the differences in the perceptions of urban freight users and stakeholders towards UCCs.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.3846/transport.2018.6593", "venue": null, "journal": "Transport", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2560223518", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["111385891", "154487076", "37238869", "109706448", "127332133", "55396735", "167506352", "130499403", "203093493", "109390851", "24876841", "153001409", "127782899", "155632748", "107644233", "55980495", "154208014", "155494988", "31246839", "107861837", "55758131", "59387467", "107201370", "144150328", "167830826", "438906", "110464350", "109156690", "144793300", "168113802", "145546518", "59031541", "56048805", "167944722", "73622574"], "inbound_citations": ["210894480", "115369820", "211107173", "210980638", "211038338"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:168584763"}

General principles and elements were drawn from the UNFCCC REDD+ policy frameworks for developing modalities and procedures for designing community forest monitoring system. The paper utilised policy analysis approach used to derive monitoring goals and objectives by assessing the compatibility of Kenya\u2019s policy and legislative framework with monitoring elements provided in the UNFCCC REDD+ policy mechanism. The elements included monitoring goals, objectives, questions, indicators, and methods and tools. Two goals were identified which included, reduction of forest carbon emissions (ER) and monitoring of multiple social and environmental safeguards (SG). Five ER related objectives were identified to include: forest reference emission levels or forest reference levels, drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, Land use activities, eligible ER actions and estimation of forest emissions. Six objectives guiding SG were identified to include: policy, governance, human rights, socio-economic, biodiversity and environmental concerns. Corresponding questions to the goals and objectives were systematically designed. In turns, indicators, depicting quantitative and qualitative measurements, which best provided answers to questions were identified. The various methods and tools used by communities around the world in providing data and information required to satisfy the indictors were identified through literature review. The review identified four methods and tools that included: Remote Sensing and GIS, GPS survey, smartphone survey and Ground trothing. Smartphone and cloud-based server technology were found to be the recent emergent tools in aiding community monitoring of REDD+ projects.

The risk profile analysis in insolvency proceedings, as an indicator of managerial and financial health, represents a challenge to complement the gaps in the literature, given the limited studies in the field, compared to the bibliography in the field of risk management, for the companies in the economic circuit. This topic is of major importance for all business environments, having in view the disasters generated by economic crises on companies. In terms of judicial reorganization and insolvency proceedings, the situation in Romania proves to be different from the practices in the countries with tradition in this field and we are referring here to the USA, Germany and France. Comparative studies have indicated dysfunctions in the reorganization procedures in Romania, related to the lack of a coercive system to remove the insolvency debtors from the economic circuit, and the lack of models for analyzing the reorganization capacity of companies in insolvency proceedings. Regarding a possible reorganization of a company, creditors do not have approved analysis models in order to vote on reorganization plans and most of the time, at least as far as public creditors are concerned, their vote is negative and unfounded. The purpose of this research is to generate a model of internal risk analysis specific to the companies undergoing insolvency proceedings and of external risks related to the activity sector, a model able to predict the possibility of reorganizing a company undergoing insolvency proceedings. The main tool used is the interview, conducted on a sample of insolvency experts in Romania, with an average experience of approx. 10-20 years in insolvency and reorganization activities.

Benchmarking credit structure in Latin America and the Caribbean, the paper finds that the region is financially underdeveloped, because the ratio of short-term credit to gross domestic product is lower than in peers; long-term credit is at par; and consumer and commercial loans are lower. The paper also explores patterns of credit growth through nonparametric regressions. The results indicate that short-term credit grows faster than long-term credit as income grows in low-income countries, but the situation reverses when countries reach high- or middle-income status. Reflecting this trend, the share of mortgage loans rises with income.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1596/1813-9450-8571", "venue": "Policy Research Working Papers", "journal": "Policy Research Working Papers", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2889153426", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["7174642", "153870130", "15118525", "59123131", "3139781", "8803378", "168005610", "198840461", "154538579", "12782202", "7054023", "167890660", "14821584", "7054023", "109391430", "53587425", "15597761", "154484149", "156233041", "59381679", "189952652", "166780103", "15505438", "166241397", "166533580", "153127727", "27105128", "10941061"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:169146723"}

To model the business process of risk management in assessing the strategic sustainability of freight transport companies, the authors propose a IDEF methodology. Based on this methodology is proposed functional model of risk management in assessing the strategic sustainability of freight transport companies, including context diagram, context diagram of decomposition diagrams. The basic operation of risk management in assessing the strategic sustainability of freight transport companies: risk classification, risk management planning, risk identification, risk analysis, risk assessment, risk treatment, monitoring and control risks. Methodical bases of allocation of risks temporal and spatial stability study management issues of strategic stability of freight transport companies. In order to identify risks provided a method of scoring. Risk assessment of the strategic sustainability of freight transport companies carried out using the theory of fuzzy sets. Based on fuzzy logic ranked risks temporal and spatial stability in the development of freight transport companies. The authors propose a method to minimize the risks of strategic stability of freight transport companies based on strategic outsourcing. Substantiated transfer into a strategic outsourcing of functions related to the analysis of long-term factors and trends of the company and the region, the development of predictive estimates to achieve the strategic objectives of the freight transport companies. Testing of a functional model of risk management in assessing the strategic sustainability of freight transport companies carried out by the example of the Chuvash Republic.

Since in the short and medium term it is unlikely to see improvements in financial literacy of individuals that may overcome the complexity of these decisions, the authorities can play an important role in designing default investment portfolios that can be aligned with expected replacement rates for the contributors. The current investment regulation of the default option induces investment in inefficient portfolios that are unlikely to bring returns above inflation, and probably will result in very low replacement rates for contributors.

Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) are being used widely as a means of meeting public infrastructure demands through private finance. The aim is to achieve value for money (VfM) through the allocation of risks to the party who can manage them more effectively. If project risks are not well managed, the project will face cost, quality and time overruns thereby affecting the viability of the project. Both Risk Management (RM) and Value Management (VM) are considered to be best practice in project management and enable organisations to define objectives when delivering complex projects whilst reducing risk and maximising value. Over the years researchers and practitioners have argued that the integration of RM and VM in a single study would avoid duplication of work and deliver better value for money thereby leading to better project outcomes. As part of an on-going doctoral study into the integration of risk management and value management in PPP projects, this paper attempts to examine the application of risk and value management practice in infrastructure development projects, predominantly in PPP projects, through semi-structured interviews conducted as a qualitative research methodology with ten industry practitioners. To achieve this aim, this paper attempts to identify the similarities between the two processes along with the benefits and critical success factors for the integration of RM and VM in PPP projects. The results suggest that, although risk and value management activities are said to be used in projects; \u201cformal\u201d RM and VM studies are rarely undertaken.

Corporate social responsibility or sustainability is an important feature in contemporary business addresses different aspects like business ethics, stakeholder\u2019s management and social performance. Effective corporate governance is expected to support effective and efficient corporate social responsibility within commercial banks. The content analysis of 10 commercial banks composing 5 Joint Venture (JV) Banks and 5 Non Joint Venture (NJV) Banks though judgmental sampling method based on stratified sampling technique was used to extract CSR disclosure items and corporate governance factors from secondary data specifically annual report for the period of one year. T-test was employed to test the level of significance. Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between corporate social responsibility disclosure and independent variables associated with corporate governance practices. The study reveals that different variables associated with corporate governance practices are positively and significantly correlated with the level of corporate social responsibility initiatives based on all three models. The paper is useful to organization and statutory bodies to take consideration of corporate governance practices which will enhance corporate social responsibility initiatives.

In this setting the retailer's order decision has a direct impact on the manufacturer's production. It is a well known phenomenon that inventory control policies at the retailer level often propagate customer demand variability towards the manufacturer, sometimes even in an amplified form (known as the bullwhip effect). The manufacturer however prefers to smooth production, and thus he prefers a smooth order pattern from the retailer. At first sight a decrease in order variability comes at the cost of an increased variance of the retailer's inventory levels, inflating the retailer's safety stock requirements. However, integrating the impact of the retailer's order decision on the manufacturer's production leads to new insights. A smooth order pattern generates shorter and less variable (production/replenishment) lead times, introducing a compensating effect on the retailer's safety stock. We show that by including the impact of the order decision on lead times, the order pattern can be smoothed to a considerable extent without increasing stock levels.

Furthermore, many of the gravel roads constructed or rehabilitated between 2005 and 2008 have come to the end of their design lives and during their life cycle, difficulties were experienced in getting required funds for maintenance. What is becoming apparent to the governments and road agencies of sub-Sahara Africa is the urge to conserve, as national asset, the gravel roads network, through the use of operational road management systems. Based on the above mentioned desire, the sub-Saharan African countries, including Tanzania, are exploring ways of strengthening the management of roads transport infrastructure. Towards that end Tanzania have two organisations responsible for managing its road networks, namely Tanzania Road Agency (TANROADS) and Local Government Authority (LGA)\u2019s district engineer\u2019s office. TANROADS is responsible for the management of trunk and regional road networks, while LGAs are responsible for the management of districts road networks. Each of these road agencies uses its own road management system. TANROADS uses Road Maintenance Management Systems (RMMS), and LGA uses District Roads Management Systems (DROMAS).

Rather than regarding the use of the euro by Montenegro and Kosovo as an unfortunate turn of events, the costs and benefits of unilateral adoption of the euro by not-yet member states of the region should be more openly appraised, and the option to 'euroise' recognised as a possibility.

While the federal PTC provides critical support to wind plants in the U.S., its so-called double-dipping provisions may also diminish the value of - or make ineffectual - certain types of state wind power incentives. In particular, if structured the wrong way, state assistance programs will undercut the value of the federal PTC to wind plant owners. It is therefore critical to determine which state incentives reduce the federal PTC, and the magnitude of this reduction. Such knowledge will help states determine which wind power incentives can be the most effective. This research concludes that certain kinds of state tax incentives are at risk of reducing the value of the federal PTC, but that federal tax law and IRS rulings are not sufficiently clear to specify exactly what kinds of incentives trigger this offset. State investment tax credits seem most likely to reduce federal PTC payments; the impact of state production tax credits as well as state property and sales tax incentives is more uncertain. Further IRS rulings will be necessary to gain clarity on these issues. State policymakers can seek such guidance from the IRS. While the IRS may not issue a definitive revenue ruling on requests from state policymakers, the IRS has in the past been willing to provide general information letters that can provide non-binding clarification on these matters.

The study uses a panel data of 200 companies from Anglo American and European countries between 2010 and 2014. The ordinary least squares regression is used to examine the relationships. Additionally, to alleviate the concern of potential endogeneity, we use fixed effect regression, two-stage least squares using instrumental variables. The results show that there is a negative and significant relationship between block ownership and risk-taking, with a greater significance among Continental European countries than among Anglo American countries. The rationale for this is that Continental European countries are more likely to have block owners who are also the co-founders and owners of their companies. Also, for the block owners in Anglo American companies, there is greater protection afforded minority shareholders because of the particular legal system in these countries. Future research could investigate risk-taking using other measures, performing interviews with firm\u2019s management, investors and owners.

Designed green ecoystem for sustainable ozone layer has been conceptualized. Design and construction of green materials and environmental engineering systems have been proposed. Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) process can be broadly defined as a study of the impacts of a proposed project, plan, project, policy or legislative action on the environment and sustainability. In this research, SEA process has been aimed to incorporate environmental and sustainability factors in to project planning and decision-making process such as project formulation and appraisal of green materials and environmental engineering systems for Matsushita Carbon Company (MCC) plant in 1979 at Tada and cotton roller ginning plant as well as certain other projects that included policies, programs, plans and legislative actions. Sustainable development is a kind of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability and efficacy of future generations to meet their own needs. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process can be defined as the systematic study of the potential impacts (effects) of proposed projects, plans, programs, policies or legislative actions relative to the physical-chemical, biological, cultural, and socioeconomic components of the total environmental product life cycle. The primary purpose of the EIA process is to encourage the consideration of the environment in Organizational\u2019s planning and decision-making process (OPDM) and to arrive at actions that are environmentally compatible. OPDM process should include the integrated consideration of technical or engineering, economic, environmental, safety, and health, social and sustainability factors to achieve business excellence. Prior to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process in 1970 in the USA, technical and economic factors dominance the World\u2019s projects. The objective of the study design conceptualization of SEA process based on fifteen number of sustainable detailed project reports (DPRs) submitted by the extension learners of Diploma in Entrepreneurship and Business Management (DEBM) course conducted by the Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (The EDI of India) during the research year (RY) 1999 to 2018 under the author\u2019s counsellorship. The design of the study is cross sectional. Environmental Health Impact Assessment (EHIA) process has been conducted for projects to consider the safety and health impacts to mitigate psychological health loadings on workers and nearby residents. Social Impact Assessment (SIA) process can be defined as the systematic identification and evaluation of the potential social impacts (effects) of proposed projects, plans, programs, or legislative action such that social consideration is encouraged in OPDM process and to arrive at actions that are socially compatible. SEA process concerns to environment and sustainability effects in OPDM process and arrive at proposed projects, plans, programs, and legislative actions that are compatible with respect to environment and sustainability issues. International EIA process required multi-disciplinary approach that has been conducted very early stage of Japanese Matsushita carbon rod project in 1982 for strategic environmental assessment. The paper highlights SEA process conducted for certain projects that based on operation and process approach and associated studies for sustainable development. Engineering product environmental lifecycle analysis (LCA) has been conducted for identifying and measuring the impact of certain industrial products on the environment by means of mass and energy balance methods. LCA considers the activities related to raw materials, transformation, ancillary materials, equipment, method, market, man power, production, use, disposal and ancillary equipment. As far as safety is concerned personal protective equipment and materials (PPEMs) that include garments, clothing, gloves, safety shoes, hard hats, safety glasses, shields, respirators, full aprons, safety belts, and other safety items which must be used by an individual. Such equipment is important for personal protection and for safety. It is the manager\u2019s and supervisor\u2019s responsibility to ensure that they are used. The enactment of worker\u2019s compensation law and occupational disease law shall increase materially the cost of insurance to industry. The increased cost and the certainty with which it is applied will put a premium on accident-prevention work. This cost can be materially reduced by the installation of safety devices. Research experience has shown that approximately 80% of all the industrial accidents are preventable. EIA and EHIA processes have been conducted for research projects to consider the safety and health impacts to mitigate psychological health loadings on workers and nearby residents. SEA system is a potentially useful element of good environmental management and sustainable development; however, as currently practiced in industries, it is far from perfection. Emphasis should be given in industries on maintaining economic viability of the operation, while in turn taking care to preserve the ecological and social sustainability of the country. International EIA process required multi-disciplinary approach that has been conducted very early stage of Indo-Matsushita Midget electrode project in 1982 at Tada for technical, economic, ecological and social sustainability [Vijayan Gurumurthy Iyer].

What are the circumstances in which factories get certified, and to what extent does being certified indicate compliance with standards? To what extent are there clear differences in the performance of certified and non-certified factories?

For the equity in health care utilization, we examined the change in concentration index (CI) for visit days, inpatient days, and health expenditure. In the case of outpatient care, CI of visit days and health expenditure were positive(favoring the rich) in both regional and employee health insurance members and both `before` and `after` the policy change.

Eye-tracking is utilised at the interface between the human and the technology side of digitalisation and it is exactly at that interface, where technological innovations translate into economic values through productivity gains, increased sales, higher realised prices, improved customer satisfaction, fewer litigation cases, longer lasting customer relationships and thereby increased lifetime customer value, more profitable management decisions and improved shareholder trust. Unfortunately, numerous frictions between \u201cmachines\u201d and humans exist at these interfaces. Over the last decades, scientists have refined methods and invented tools to detect those frictions, reflected in visual perception: eye-tracking.

The conceptual framework used in this research has been drawn from marketing, finance, and organizational behavior theory. Specifically, relationships related to learning orientation, sources of competitive advantage, and business performance have been identified. This research develops and tests a framework about learning orientation and its consequences in an organization. Specifically, this study focused on several research questions, including: 1)Is there a relationship between learning orientation and business performance in terms of the achievement of sales and profit objectives in pure service and service-reliantorganizations?, 2) Is there a relationship between learning orientation and competitive advantage in pure service and service-reliant organizations?, and 3) Does competitive advantage moderate the relationship between learning orientation and business performance in pure service and service-reliant organizations? A survey-based research methodology is used to explore these research questions and pertinent findings reported in the light of previous studies (Martinette, 2006, Martinette and Obenchain-Leeson, 2010).

At the same time, advances in technology and changes in methods for collecting explicit customer feedback are generating increasing volumes of unstructured textual data, making it difficult for managers to analyze and interpret this information. Consequently, text mining, a method enabling automatic extraction of information from textual data, is gaining in popularity. However, this method has performed below expectations in terms of depth of analysis of customer experience feedback and accuracy. In this study, we advance linguistics-based text mining modeling to inform the process of developing an improved framework. The proposed framework incorporates important elements of customer experience, service methodologies, and theories such as cocreation processes, interactions, and context. This more holistic approach for analyzing feedback facilitates a deeper analysis of customer feedback experiences, by encompassing three value creation elements: activities, resources, and context (ARC). Empirical results show that the ARC framework facilitates the development of a text mining model for analysis of customer textual feedback that enables companies to assess the impact of interactive service processes on customer experiences. The proposed text mining model shows high accuracy levels and provides flexibility through training. As such, it can evolve to account for changing contexts over time and be deployed across different (service) business domains; we term it an \"open learning\" model. The ability to timely assess customer experience feedback represents a prerequisite for successful cocreation processes in a service environment.", "year": 2014, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1177/1094670514524625", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Service Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2165740683", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["18200693", "17446675", "26221165", "167433776", "168036984", "167577075", "141944296", "167595150", "154629207", "1469556", "54598447", "154019176", "18397233", "52853287", "167765665", "146450423", "18600000", "6374142", "2795175", "14380011", "15861127", "168157446", "2999757", "167711862", "55968884", "166717463", "9384200", "167406007", "207155218", "59335458", "61400882", "45524399", "167993397", "154378426", "34587021", "167562644", "6884774", "60826687", "18419382", "59476464", "54640352", "12289690", "2436419", "143684250", "207178694", "211638318", "56252870", "167941199", "59138461", "6358316", "168107820", "154581129", "13880182", "6961863", "167996119", "27904792", "32416999", "3181362", "19278499", "167466456", "207113096", "484335", "34067062", "142849456", "17031157", "167638341", "26341618", "53620880", "108256133", "55037981", "167930826", "10496419", "9921555", "988830", "168571", "145918328", "15549339"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:3867585"}

One explanation, proposed in the past, is that if state firms can be induced to maximize pretax profits, then state ownership may be less inefficient than private ownership when corporate tax rates are high. If this argument were right, the capital intensity of state-owned firms should fall with privatization. The data instead show that firms lay off workers when they are privatized. Why? This Paper argues that the government can use cheap loans from state-owned banks to maintain the capital stock of privately owned firms at an efficient level, in spite of a high corporate tax rate. State-owned firms should then have the same capital intensity as equivalent privately owned firms. The Paper then argues that many other distortions to a private firm's incentives, e.g. the minimum wage, result in their employing too few low-skilled workers. State-owned firms, in contrast, can be induced to hire the desired number of such workers.

In this paper, the problem of green supplier selection based on low-carbon economy is studied. Concretely, an evaluation index system for green supplier selection under the low-carbon economy is presented, and then a multi-attribute decision model of green supplier selection is established based on the method of analytic hierarchy process (AHP). This model provides decision reference for the department of supply chain management. Introduction Due to the increasingly serious global environmental problems, there are serious threat for the human survival and development. In today's global climate growing, countries are seeking the path of sustainable development. China is the largest developing country in the world at present, but also is the superpower on greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, to study the problem of carbon dioxide emissions is not only conducive to China's sustainable development, but also makes an important contribution to the global greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate global warming,. The emergence of green suppliers plays a key role to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, so to seek the right green supplier under low-carbon economy have profound significance to the business development of a company and global climate change. China has joined the WTO, which provides more and better development platform, but some domestic small and medium sized companies do not change the previous production management idea, and still remain in the previous model of development, so that there are a series of questions in the procurement management of enterprises. First, companies are not good at using the Internet information platform to seek this development opportunities, but stick to the old path of development, i.e., the choice of suppliers to comply with the principle of proximity or from the perspective of a single price consideration, without considering the influence of green suppliers on the low-carbon economy, and can not choose the right green suppliers to cooperate. Secondly, the choice of suppliers is more dependent on the decision of the competent subjective consciousness, so supplier selection contains too much personal subjective factors. Finally, many companies will focus too much on product manufacturers, thus ignoring the concerns of the procurement management. In this case, the purchasing department can easily consider only the price of the product, thereby ignoring other issues, thereby affecting the quality and effectiveness of procurement. So it is of great practical significance to seek effective green supplier selection methods. For the problem of green supplier selection under low-carbon economy, many experts and scholars established many valuable mathematical models, which provide good guide for us. For example, Sun [1] presented an evaluation index system of sustainable development, and used the methods which combined the qualitative with quantitative idea to evaluate the supplier selection based on the Delphi method and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. He also studied the problem of green supplier evaluation. Song [2] used the AHP method to determine the weights of evaluation attributes, and established a comprehensive evaluation model based on combination weights and triangle fuzzy International Conference on Applied Science and Engineering Innovation (ASEI 2015) \u00a9 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 297 function, and used empirical analysis to verify the validity of the evaluation model. Ruan [3] established a supplier evaluation system in green supply chain management according to the supplier specific circumstances in China's manufacturing enterprises, and then he used the SPSS statistical software to do the clustering analysis for the green supply chain data, and verified the rationality of index classification. At last, he used the method of ELECTRE-I for supplier selection decisions and got the comprehensive evaluation results for manufacturing suppliers. In this paper, based on the study on the existing supplier selection, we put forward a new evaluation system of green supplier selection under low-carbon economy, and established a multi-attribute decision model for supplier selection based on the theoretical basis of a low-carbon economy and multi-attribute decision making theory. Our aim is to help companies to choose the best suppliers scientifically and effectively. Evaluation System of Green Supplier Selection When we construct the index system of green supplier selection, we should add the low-carbon, environmental and other factors into the traditional supplier selection evaluation system from the theoretical basis and content of green supply chain, which can reflect the social responsibility of corporate, and is line with the development requirements of low-carbon economy and green supply chain. Combined with relevant information of existing supplier selection methods [4-10], here we present an index system which includes five attributes, i.e., environmental performance, economic capacity, production capacity, service capacity and supply capacity, and the sub-attributes of each attribute are listed as shown in Table 1.

The main idea is to do a few steps such as construct hierarchical structure model, construct the two-two comparison matrix, determine the single sorting and hierarchical total sorts, and then get the hierarchy of the components relative to the overall goal of a combination weights, and the final evaluation results of different feasible schemes can be obtained. The detailed steps are given as follows.

We investigate the average effect of R&D tax credits on a series of innovation indicators such as number of new products, sales with new products, originality of innovation etc. using a non-parametric matching approach. Compared to a hypothetical situation in the absence of R&D tax credits, recipients of tax credits show significantly better scores on most but not all performance indicators.

In 1990, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) made funds available to public housing authorities to combat drug and crime problems. This program, the Drug Elimination Program (DEP) combined several strategies under one administrative umbrella: police enforcement, drug treatment, drug prevention, youth and gang outreach, community organizing, integrated health and social service agencies, and tenant mobilization projects. In New York, the Housing Authority spent $165 million on DEP in its 330 public housing sites between 1990 and 1996. Yet there has been little research on this large investment, either in New York City or nationwide. In this study, we examined the effects of the DEP intervention at three levels of complementary theoretical relevance: the public housing development itself, the neighborhood in which public housing is situated, and the police precinct that surrounds each public housing project. We used spatial analyses and hierarchical regressions to estimate DEP effects on drug and crime in public housing sites and their surrounding neighborhoods. We show that crime and drug problems were reduced significantly in the immediate neighborhoods and police precincts surrounding the public housing sites, but crime and drug problems in public housing sites were unaffected by DEP interventions. The absence of effects within public housing reflects the details of the DEP strategies, with its disproportionate allocation of funds to policing strategies compared to demand reduction and informal social control programs. DEP police efforts were nominally focused on public housing sites, but in reality were diffused in the NYPD's broader administrative units to provide resources that benefited law enforcement generally. Seen this way, DEP was an important and strategically valuable supplement to the NYPD's strategic response to a particularly acute violence and crime epidemic, but did little to alter the basic social organization of crime and drugs within public housing sites. We argue for an intervention model that promotes collective action between residents and legal actors, interactions that promote citizen compliance and cooperation with police. The police depend heavily on the voluntary cooperation of citizens to fight crime, and DEP created disincentives for cooperation. This social norms approach would invite policing of drug problems in the context of a legitimacy-focused approach that promotes citizen-based regulation of crime and disorder.", "year": 2005, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.716821", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1505392736", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54742411"}

In this paper the authors examine how meeting foreign standards affects firms' export performance, reflected in export propensity and market diversification. The analysis draws on the World Bank Technical Barriers to Trade Survey database of 619 firms in 17 developing countries. The results indicate that technical regulations in industrial countries adversely affect firms' propensity to export in developing countries. In particular, testing procedures and lengthy inspection procedures reduce exports by 9 percent and 3percent, respectively. Furthermore, in the model, the difference in standards across foreign countries causes diseconomy of scale for firms and affects decisions about whether to enter export markets. The empirical analysis presented here implies that standards impede exporters' market entry, reducing the likelihood of exporting to more than three markets by 7 percent.

The main sustenance for slaves, beef jerky was the most important industry in southern Brazil. Nevertheless, by 1850, producers were already worried that they could not compete with Uruguayan industry.

Recent research also raises the possibility of a Brazilian \"Dutch disease\",which resulted from the coffee export boom. We test both hypotheses and argue that Brazilian production's decline was associated with structural changes in demand for low-quality meat.

It also evaluates the recent developments in these Small Business Support institutions. Problem investigated: Many small businesses are still excluded from funds and support from Small Business Support Institutions. The paper investigates the extent to which these institutions provided financial as well as non-financial support to SMMEs in South Africa during the period 1996 to 2003. The paper further explores the changes in the legislation in 2004 in this regard, and explains how it intends to extent support to SMMEs. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper assesses the small business development policy framework in terms of the functions and assistance of the Small Business Support institutions. Secondly, it analyses the microeconomic evaluation of the services provided for the period 1996 to 2003. This is followed by a macroeconomic evaluation of the impact of support programmes on employment creation, poverty alleviation and economic empowerment. Lastly, the successes and shortcomings of these support programmes are identified and changes since 2003 discussed. Findings/Implications: The fact that many SMMEs still do not get support, points to the shortcomings in the support programmes. Most programmes do not cater for the very small and micro-enterprises and most benefits from these programmes benefit SMMEs in urban areas. Originality/Value: The paper finds an original way to explain the shortcomings of Small Business Support institutions and the lack of data from these institutions since 2003. These institutions must do more than banks and also help those that can not be accommodated by commercial banks.

The evaluation of these projects is usually limited to the implementation process i.e. measuring the ability of the project to meet the set deliverables. Factors that are considered are the cost and time specified for the installation of the DRWH systems and the quality of the harvested water. There is seldom a post-project evaluation to determine whether the beneficiaries are able to properly maintain the system and or to improve on it, or whether the project is leading to increased household collection and use of rainwater in the project location and its environs. This paper is based on a survey of key stakeholders actively involved in the promotion of DRWH over a number of years. Active involvement was the basis of accepting the information on their perception as adequate in providing a reliable measure of the level of success of DRWH projects. The metrics for success were based on stakeholders\u2019 perspective of the success of DRWH projects as determined by community involvement, rate of uptake of DRWH, increased awareness, impact of training on maintenance of systems, appropriate use of the systems, increased use of rainwater, increased capacity of community leaders to train and improved support by local private sector. It was found that there was willingness to invest in DRWH particularly among the stakeholders who have regularly used rainwater. The stakeholders were also asked to corroborate a set of pre-selected factors that were considered important for the successful development of DRWH projects. A ranking of these factors indicated that although the cost of the DRWH systems was the most important factor for success, technical issues were imperceptibly more important than economic and social issues.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5539/jsd.v9n5p55", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Sustainable Development", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2525557005", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["93649692", "116338026", "2302445", "111086280", "154267978", "128880610", "129485176", "53469891", "111085048", "109916034", "82441807", "109377008", "154819139", "167747334", "100976118"], "inbound_citations": ["73643748"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55004797"}

The purpose of this study is to find the effects of customer equity drivers on customer loyalty and to examine cultural differences between South Korea and United States. Methodology/Approach: This study sets independent variables of value equity, brand equity and relationship equity from the customer equity model and tests to see how each equity driver affects customers' loyalty through gaining their trust and satisfaction in the discount store industry. We applied structural equation model to test the hypothesis. We conducted a survey on customers who had shopping experiences in discount stores and gathered data from United States and South Korea respectively. Findings: The results show that there are significant differences in the effects of customer drivers on customer loyalty via trust and satisfaction in large retail industries.

The objective is to investigate and evaluate the nature of the business, then to determine the importance of implementation of entrepreneurial orientation and utilization of network resources for the internationalization of small and medium sized enterprises in Pakistan. It is proposed that the intensity of internationalization of small and medium sized enterprises is enhanced by development of organizational practices and cultural environment. An overview is provided of the importance of SME sector in Pakistan for the economic growth of the country. The current state of SME sector has been evaluated. It proceeds with the discussion of the factors essential for fostering the growth of SMEi\u00afs in Pakistan. The importance of these factors such as strong entrepreneurial orientation and utilization of network resources has also been considered for the internationalization of small and medium sized enterprises in Pakistan. The paper concludes with the assessments of implications of these factors and suggestions for future research. Information is provided regarding the current situation of SMEi\u00afs in Pakistan and the factors for the international growth of this sector have also been identified and studied. Factors under consideration are strong entrepreneurial orientation and utilization of network resources. Few hypotheses made regarding the implication of these factors have been evaluated and tested by several statistical methods. For the internationalization of SMEi\u00afs in Pakistan these factors have been given special attention. In the industrial development of a country the importance of the SME sector cannot be ignored. SMEs constitute nearly 90% of all the enterprises in Pakistan; employ 80% of the non-agricultural labor force; and their share in the annual GDP is 40%, approximately. However, Pakistan Small and Medium Enterprises sector is facing many problems and challenges both domestic and international in achieving economics of scale and better prospects in marketing their products at international market and to gain the competitive advantage. Demand of the global era requires entrepreneurs who are willing to face risks, innovative, proactive and compete aggressively to be able to seek new opportunities and increase competition advantages. Innovation is needed to provide value added products through value creation, so that the competitive advantage could be gained. Entrepreneurs can utilize open source that involves external parties by utilizing network resources. This paper calls attention to ways in which SMEi\u00afs of Pakistan can survive in this competitive environment. This paper investigates the chief factors for the internationalization of SMEi\u00afs of Pakistan specifically focusing on the entrepreneurial orientation determinants such as pro-activeness, risk taking and competitive aggressiveness and utilization of network resources.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.5539/ijms.v10n2p118", "venue": null, "journal": "International Journal of Marketing Studies", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2804195875", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["13652226", "13836294", "154194042", "168120245", "146558039", "55927924", "154383107", "166876730", "154394547", "153656933", "154677650", "167517511", "168083535", "154275652", "144168027", "167977255", "154735756", "166332503", "634711", "167605974", "18043649", "166464435", "114314231", "167514449", "154658297", "155079160", "153762768", "167578179", "145602911", "167905848", "168111756", "31791458", "168045011", "153789505", "56122712", "6566608", "166682854", "154398384", "55677902", "12170686", "106678093", "153544095", "157573799", "154574162", "167207558", "144861020", "168731703", "143588383"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54899515"}

These data were used to analyse (1) how well team members were connected with each other (density), (2) whether team members\u2019 relationships were mutual (reciprocity) and (3) whether all team members were equally important for the data team network (centralisation). Moreover, different types of knowledge brokering (inward, outward and forward) were examined to further understand knowledge exchange between data team members and their colleagues. Qualitative data were analysed to triangulate these findings for four particular cases.

The Pilbara Regional Investment Blueprint(Pilbara Blueprint), developed by the Pilbara Development Commission (Commission), establishes a vision for the region that seeks diverse, innovative and resilient commercial opportunities that are underpinned by capability development, investment capture and fostering growth, as well as maintaining a strong resources and energy industry. Key challenges for the achievement of this vision include complex planning and regulatory processes, as well as competition for productive land. ::: Concurrently, the modern Australian mining and energy industry is nearing maturity, with an increasing number of operations approaching closure and providing opportunity for the consideration of repurposing mined land and associated assets for productive economic use. Although good examples of mine repurposing exist at both the global and national levels, current mine closure planning practices within both government and industry do not readily support or encourage repurposing as a beneficial outcome. ::: The Commission has therefore engaged with government and industry stakeholders to develop a framework that aligns the objectives of minimising post-closure mining liability and achieving sustainable regional development, and that presents a unique opportunity to shift the current mine closure paradigm. Specifically, the Commission is building from existing land access and tenure frameworks to enhance existing transformational opportunities within the Pilbara, including renewable power generation, irrigated agriculture and tourism.

Multinational corporatios have been a driving force behind these developments. As a transition economy, Poland provides an interesting case for study, as its sudden opening to foreign investment after a long period of isolation allows the process of integratio into global networks to be studies more clearly. Using Poland as a case study, the authors study multinational corporatios'role in integrating a host country into the increasingly international division of labor. They provide evidence that inflows of foreign direct investment are increasing Poland's participation in global production and distribution networks.

Using matched bank-firm level data, I find that mergers disrupt lending relationships, specially to small borrowers of target banks. However, I find significant positive effects of mergers for borrowers that continue the lending relationship with the consolidated bank. On average, consolidated banks reduce loan interest rates. The most beneficial mergers from the borrower point of view are those involving two large banks and commercial banks. While the reduction in interest rates is larger when the acquirer and the target have some market overlap, the decline is much smaller when there is a significant increase in local banking market concentration.

Building on evidence from the literature, the paper systematises and highlights some of the potential problems in the governance of cooperative firms concerning the accomplishment of cooperative mutualistic aims. In exploring the internal conditions that may affect cooperative performance, we focus in particular on the role of rules and incentives towards such aims. In synergy, when analysing the external conditions that may affect cooperative performance, the paper addresses possible sources of external control, such as those related to the nature of the business relationships between the cooperative and its production network. In taking into account both internal and external conditions, we consider an extended notion of governance, whereby those who impact on strategic decision-making are not to be searched only within the internal governance bodies, typically the board of directors or managers, but also outside the cooperative, as in the extended network of production relationships in which the organisation is embedded.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2326938", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2166830819", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["155053021", "152999915", "153677992", "142932681", "154092094", "155040267", "154707046", "142946478", "42913744", "152540760", "154028575", "55055945", "56441781", "154907520", "154404105", "143920850", "159019210", "158080075", "154272568", "55880931", "2901235", "146610453", "12531373", "153460341", "15363674", "152155249", "155112388", "145539184", "141645009", "18139596", "155919983", "167201386", "167424183", "59518028", "155015334", "154451661", "167927695", "153152523", "56225622", "153351212", "142837447", "154765096", "204401504", "145793944", "154289104", "197879123", "9837398", "154584207", "154098476", "144705965", "143250530", "154540102", "153877984", "18070354", "172030222", "153785003", "154506781", "17728450"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54704299"}

We argue that this issue is even more important for unlisted funds, particularly if they invest in very illiquid assets. Using the investment performance of UK Real Estate open-ended unlisted funds, we also analyze the impact of managerial, economical and investor variables on the pricing of real estate mutual funds. Our empirical results show that both illiquidity is attached to a higher expected return as investors are willing to pay a price for liquid assets, and higher returns attract more investors driving liquidity up. Particularly, we find that overall transaction volumes contain little information unless we separate between inflows and outflows. Furthermore, we find that returns are influenced by the direction of flows (either buying or selling side) and that fund types and some asset manageris characteristics are not significant and should then be dismissed in the asset allocation process. Finally, through a montecarlo simulation we show a smart-money effect where using this set of information to build portfolios of funds may have a significant impact on the likelihood of over-performing the benchmark.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.15396/eres2010_250", "venue": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual European Real Estate Society Conference - Milan, Italy", "journal": "Proceedings of the 17th Annual European Real Estate Society Conference - Milan, Italy", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1864382702", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["154969632", "153372905", "153856653", "15506084", "166967515", "154463942", "18029114", "154342793", "154421341", "152967168", "155061692", "55272584", "154097782", "157070891", "154082208", "59384332", "154688806", "8732116"], "inbound_citations": ["159114588", "211168581"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:54707668"}

However, there is very little non-survey based empirical evidence on the availabil- ity of credit post-bankruptcy and its dependence on the credit cycle. Using data from one of the largest credit bureaus in the US, this paper makes three contributions. First, we show that individuals whole for bankruptcy are indeed penalized with limited credit access post-bankruptcy, but wend that this con- sequence is very short lived. Ninety percent of individuals have access to some sort of credit within the 18 months afterling for bankruptcy, and 75% are given unsecured credit. Second, we show that those individuals who have the easiest access to credit after bankruptcy tend to be the ones who have shown previously the least ability and least propensity to repay their debt. In fact, a signicant fraction of indi- viduals at the bottom of the credit quality spectrum seem to receive more credit afterling. We interpret the widespread post-bankruptcy credit access and the differential credit provision across borrower types as evidence that lenders target riskier borrowers. Employing a simple theoretical framework we show that this interpretation is consistent with a prot maximizing lender whose optimal strategy involves seg- menting borrowers by observable credit quality and bankruptcy status. This interpretation is also in line with survey evidence that shows lenders repeatedly solicit debtors to borrow after bankruptcy, especially with offers of revolving credit. Finally, we show that ourndings depend heavily on the aggregate credit environment: the ease of credit and limited bankruptcy credit cost observed in the initial period of our data (2003-2004) become much less signicant when we repeat the analyses in 2007, as the recent credit downturn began.", "year": 2009, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.1341856", "venue": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "journal": "SSRN Electronic Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2132657378", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["158545238", "153676410", "67793346", "59487769", "59406808", "150523345", "18691159", "154884872", "19506766", "54878392", "154539056", "157788486"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2110058"}

Decision regarding re-visiting an ecotourism destination depends on the level of satisfaction that the eco-tourist experienced during his or her first time visit to the destination. Eco-tourists who are satisfied with the ecotourism destination during their first time visit are likely to re-visit the destination but those who are not satisfied are not likely to re-visit.

{"paper_id": "154879176", "title": "The U.S. proposed carbon tariffs, WTO scrutiny and China's responses.", "authors": [{"first": "ZhongXiang", "middle": [], "last": "Zhang", "suffix": ""}], "abstract": "With countries from around the world set to meet in Copenhagen to try to hammer out a post-2012 climate change agreement, no one would disagree that a U.S. commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions is essential to such a global pact. However, despite U.S. president Obama\u2019s recent announcement to push for a commitment to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 17% by 2020, in reality it is questionable whether U.S. Congress will agree to specific emissions cuts, although they are not ambitious at all from the perspectives of both the EU and developing countries, without the imposition of carbon tariffs on Chinese products to the U.S. market, even given China\u2019s own recent announcement to voluntarily seek to reduce its carbon intensity by 40-45% over the same period. This dilemma is partly attributed to flaws in current international climate negotiations, which have been focused on commitments on the two targeted dates of 2020 and 2050. However, if the international climate change negotiations continue on their current course without extending the commitment period to 2030, which would really open the possibility for the U.S. and China to make the commitments that each wants from the other, the inclusion of border carbon adjustment measures seems essential to secure passage of any U.S. legislation capping its own greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the joint WTO-UNEP report indicates that border carbon adjustment measures might be allowed under the existing WTO rules, depending on their specific design features and the specific conditions for implementing them. Against this background, this paper argues that, on the U.S. side, there is a need to minimize the potential conflicts with WTO provisions in designing such border carbon adjustment measures. The U.S. also needs to explore, with its trading partners, cooperative sectoral approaches to advancing low-carbon technologies and/or concerted mitigation efforts in a given sector at the international level. Moreover, to increase the prospects for a successful WTO defence of the Waxman-Markey type of border adjustment provision, there should be: 1) a period of good faith efforts to reach agreements among the countries concerned before imposing such trade measures; 2) consideration of alternatives to trade provisions that could reasonably be expected to fulfill the same function but are not inconsistent or less inconsistent with the relevant WTO provisions; and 3) trade provisions that should allow importers to submit equivalent emission reduction units that are recognized by international treaties to cover the carbon contents of imported products. Meanwhile, being targeted by such border carbon adjustment measures, China needs to, at the right time, indicate a serious commitment to address climate change issues to challenge the legitimacy of the U.S. imposing carbon tariffs by signaling well ahead that it will take on binding absolute emission caps around the year 2030, and needs the three transitional periods of increasing climate obligations before taking on absolute emissions caps. This paper argues that there is a clear need within a climate regime to define comparable efforts towards climate mitigation and adaptation to discipline the use of unilateral trade measures at the international level. As exemplified by export tariffs that China applied on its own during 2006-08, the paper shows that defining the comparability of climate efforts can be to China\u2019s advantage. Furthermore, given the fact that, in volume terms, energy-intensive manufacturing in China values 7 to 8 times that of India, and thus carbon tariffs have a greater impact on China than on India, the paper questions whether China should hold the same stance on this issue as India as it does now, although the two largest developing countries should continue to take a common position on other key issues in international climate change negotiations.", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10368-010-0166-8", "venue": null, "journal": "International Economics and Economic Policy", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2779062858,2159749863,2743628789", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business", "Economics"], "outbound_citations": ["154930744", "157235392", "154648830", "158622376", "168343016", "168343016", "44004341", "19778416", "153335353", "153467169", "154572142", "154421427", "168411285"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:154879176"}

While modern trade penetration in India is still low, the proportionate private label growth is much higher owing to a new generation of shoppers that is open to trying out new products and brands.It is thus important to understand the private label motivators in India and also to understand the role of product category in the private label decision. This particular study aims at these two objectives in the Indian context. The findings of the study indicate that product category does have an intervening role in the customer\u2019s private label purchase decision. The implications need to be assessed and incorporated in the private label strategy of the retailers.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.12725/ujbm.33.4", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of business management", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2943520789", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": ["202631334", "14713843", "208195401", "166651681", "143396091"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:169769540"}
