       "  'text': 'Gene therapy holds potential for treating many severe diseases, such as cancer and genetic diseases. 1 Successful gene therapy depends on highefficiency gene delivery processes, in which the gene carriers have an essential role. The application of traditional viral vectors has been a challenge because of their toxicity, immunogenicity and low capability for scaling up. 2 There has long been a scientific demand for developing non-viral gene delivery systems that can overcome the drawbacks of viral vectors. 3 Non-viral gene delivery has been advanced by the rapid development of materials science and technology. Numerous novel gene delivery systems have been proposed based on functional cationic polymers, such as polyethylenimine (PEI), [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate), 4,10 poly(L-lysine), 11 poly(aspartic acid) 12, 13 and polyamidoamine. 14 However, these non-viral gene carriers still have shortcomings, including cytotoxicity, low transfection efficiency and lack of multifunction.',\n",

To further improve the performance of PGMA-based gene carriers, several strategies have been applied such as polysaccharide introduction and target molecule binding. 16, 17 Owing to the dynamically unable ability of supramolecular polymers, the application of supramolecular chemistry for gene delivery has been a hot research topic in the biomedical field. 18, 19 The construction of supramolecular polycations via host-guest interaction is a popular strategy for high-efficiency gene delivery systems. 20 In particular, cyclodextrins (CDs) and their derivatives have been widely utilized for constructing supramolecular gene delivery systems, mainly because of their superior biocompatibility. [21] [22] [23] With the host-guest interaction strategy, we successfully prepared one PGEA-based supramolecular delivery system by tying multiple β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)cored star PGEA polymers to an adamantine-modified linear PGEA backbone. 24 Such PGEA supramolecules markedly increased transfection efficiencies. Further improvements in functionality and the development of new preparation strategies for PGMA-based supramolecular vectors would benefit the construction of better gene delivery systems.',\n",

       "  'text': 'To construct multifunctional supramolecular vectors, a novel strategy was proposed to flexibly prepare PGMA-based supramolecular delivery systems (PGED-Gd@PGEAs) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) functionality, by assembling multiple adamantine-headed star PGEA (Ad-PGEA) units with a versatile PGED-CD-Gd backbone (Scheme 1). This backbone possessed numerous flanking β-CD species and Gd 3+ ions. MRI technology has received considerable attention because of its high spatial resolution and its applications in areas such as deep tissue imaging. 25, 26 In particular, Gd 3+ ions have been used as contrast agents because of their optimal chemical and magnetic properties. 27, 28 In this work, Gd ions were chelated by diethylenetriaminepentacetate acid (DTPA) immobilized on the PGED backbones to introduce the MRI effect into the resultant PGED-Gd@PGEA supramolecular systems. The physicochemical properties of the PGED-Gd@PGEA assemblies, including plasmid DNA (pDNA) condensation ability, cytotoxicity, gene transfection, cellular uptake and MRI functionality, were examined in detail.

The PGED-CD-Gd backbone possessed numerous flanking β-CD species and Gd 3+ ions. For the preparation of the PGED-CD-Gd backbone, the starting PGMA (Mn = 4.6 × 10 3 g mol −1 , PDI= 1.28) with 32 repeat units was first synthesized via ATRP. Then, PGMA was functionalized with excess ED by ring-opening addition to produce PGED with abundant primary amine groups. Similar to our previous study, 16 it was confirmed that the PGED was successfully prepared from the NMR results ( Supplementary Figure S1(a1) ). To introduce β-CD units, CD-EP that possessed one epoxy ring (Supplementary Figure S1(a2) ) was immobilized onto PGED via ring-opening Figure S1(a3) ), the molar ratio of β-CD and ED units was 1:2, indicating that every PGED-CD chain contained 16 β-CD units. DTPA, the chelating agent of Gd 3+ ions, was subsequently reacted with the remaining primary amine groups of PGED-CD via the amidation reaction, producing PGED-CD-DTPA. Based on the 1 H NMR spectrum of PGED-CD-DTPA ( Supplementary  Figure S1(a4) ), PGED-CD-DTPA contained~12 DPTA units. The resultant PGED-CD-Gd backbone was obtained by the chelation of PGED-CD-DTPA with Gd 3+ ions. According to the thermogravimetric analysis (Supplementary Figure S2) , the PGED-CD-Gd backbone contained~10 Gd 3+ ions, which was fairly consistent with the number of DPTA units.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Characterization of polymer/pDNA nanocomplexes For non-viral polycationic gene carriers, the ability to condense pDNA into a nanoparticle is essential because nanocomplexes of carrier and pDNA are more suitable for cellular uptake. In this work, agarose gel electrophoresis, particle size and ζ-potential measurements, as well as AFM images, were used to confirm the ability of PGMA-based polycations to condense pDNA. The gel retardation results of polymer/pDNA complexes with increasing N/P ratios are shown in Figure 1 . All PGED@PGEA and PGED-Gd@PGEA could compact pDNA completely within the N/P ratio of 1.5, whereas the PGED-CD-Gd backbone and Ad-PGEA guests only condensed pDNA when N/P ratios reached 2.5. The above results indicated that the pDNAcondensing ability of PGED@PGEA and PGED-Gd@PGEA is better than that of PGED-CD-Gd and Ad-PGEA, which is probably because of the high molecular weight supramolecular structures. 35 The particle size and the ζ-potential of polymer/pDNA complexes with increasing N/P ratio are shown in Figure 2 . The particle sizes of all complexes decreased with increasing N/P ratios. At lower N/P ratios, loose aggregates with large size were formed owing to the few positive charges on the polymers. 36 With an increase in the N/P ratios, the diameters of all complexes decreased to 100-150 nm, which enabled the complexes to easily undergo endocytosis. It was also noted that at both low and high N/P ratios, the polycation/pDNA complexes had good stability (Supplementary Figure S4 ). In addition to particle sizes, the ζ-potential of polymer/pDNA complexes are another factor that affects cellular uptake. All of the complexes had positive ζ-potentials, and the values of the ζ-potential slightly increased with the N/P ratios. Owing to the positive charges, polymer/pDNA complexes had a good affinity for the negatively charged cell membrane and were able to facilitate cellular uptake. 37 The ζ-potential values of PGED@PGEA and PGED-Gd@PGEA groups were higher than those of the PGED-CD-Gd backbone and Ad-PGEA guests, once again confirming that PGMA-based supramolecular polycations possessed better DNA-compacting ability.',\n",
